The Zaire Integrated Infrastructure Phase I loan is part of an oil-backed credit line that Angola signed with Eximbank on September 28; 2007 (1) (2). The 2007 credit line is structured as a framework agreement under which individual loan agreements (ILAs) are entered into; each ILA may finance up to 90% of a project’s contract (1). Sonangol; Angola’s parastatal oil company; is the guarantor of the facility; and repayment is made with proceeds from Sonangol’s oil sales to China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC); which are deposited in an account with Eximbank (3). Loans under the 2007 facility carry a 5-year grace period; 15-year repayment period; and an interest rate equal to the floating LIBOR rate plus 1.25% (3) (4). By December 31; 2017; Angola had drawn down the maximum of US$2B allowed under this arrangement (1).

Sometime in 2007-2008; Angola signed the loan agreement with Eximbank to finance 90% of a US$113;151;577.50 contract for Phase I of this project (2). In 2008; China’s Ministry of Commerce provided Angolan authorities with a list of companies from which to choose the final contractor (2). The total contract value of all phases of the Zaire infrastructure project was said to be US$400M. Available information on the identity of the contractor or implementation progress of Phase I is limited.

This project was contracted to Sinohydro. Construction began in 2013 and concluded in 2017.

The Chiumbe-Dala loan is part of an oil-backed credit line signed between Angola and Eximbank on November 18; 2009 (1). The facility is structured as a framework agreement under which individual loan agreements (ILAs); able to finance up to 90% of a given project’s contract; are entered into (1). According to an amendment to the original agreement signed on June 8; 2011; the amount available under the 2009 credit line is a function of Sonangol’s daily oil sales to Eximbank-designated Chinese importers; it can increase from US$3B to a maximum of US$6B (1). As of June 30; 2019; Angola had drawn down a total of US$1.67B under the 2009 facility (1).

Sinohydro officially launched construction on the Chiumbe-Dala project on July 8; 2013 (2). Nearly a year later; on May 9; 2014; the vice president of Eximbank and the Angolan finance minister signed 3 loan agreements; including the loan for the rehabilitation of Chiumbe-Dala and its Luena substation (3) (4). The inauguration ceremony for the renovated hydroelectric plant; substation; and transmission network was held on April 5; 2017 (5).

This project was contracted to Sinohydro and Tebian Electric Apparatus Co (TBEA). Construction began in 2013 and concluded in 2017.

In October 2013; Sinohydro and TBEA began construction on the substations and transmission lines that make up the Soyo-Kapary network (1). From its inception; the project was expected to receive EBC financing from Eximbank and insurance from Sinosure (2). In January 2014; China’s State Council officially approved a loan to underwrite the project; which had by that time reached a total contract value of US$1.18B (3). By June 2016; TBEA reported that the Soyo-Kapary transmission network was nearing the end of its “first phase” of construction and beginning its second phase (4).

Authorities projected in 2017 that the project would be completed by June of that year (5). In 2019; the Soyo-Kapary network won an award reserved for projects completed before June 30; 2017; suggesting that it had been completed within the projected time frame (6). The project involved the construction of at least 700 km of 220-400 kV transmission lines and four 400 kV substations (2).

This project was contracted to China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). Construction began in 2015 and concluded in 2019.

In 2014; Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water and CMEC signed the commercial contract for Phase I of the Soyo I power plant (1). In January 2015; CMEC announced that it would begin construction of the plant because it had received its first installment of the Angolan government’s US$147.7M (15%) share of the US$982M total contract price (1). On June 9; 2015; Angola and ICBC signed the US$837.5M facility agreement to finance the remaining 85% of the contract (2). The ICBC facility has a total term of 15 years; which includes a 5-year grace period and 10-year repayment period; and is insured by China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) (2). The agreement specified that the facility’s availability period would end in June 2020.

A visit by the Angolan secretary of energy to the Soyo I construction site; located in Zaire province; confirmed in September 2015 that CMEC had begun construction (3). By August 2016; the director of the project estimated the plant was 45% complete (4). By February 2019; Soyo I had reached 94.3% completion (5); and the plant was reportedly completed and awaiting commissioning by August 2019 (6). The power plant’s four gas turbines and two steam turbines give it a total installed capacity of 750 MW. It is intended to help fulfill ambitious rural electrification goals across Zaire province (3). A second phase of the Soyo I project will involve expanding its installed capacity to 1;500 MW through the construction of a secondary plant (3) (6).

On June 11; 2015; Angola signed the EPC contract for the Caculo Cabaça project; worth US$4.532B in total; with a joint venture (JV) of Angolan and Chinese contractors majority-owned by CGGC (1). On September 8; 2016; ICBC confirmed that it would finance the CGGC hydropower project in Angola (2); the Angolan government confirmed the same in November 2016 (3). The facility; a syndicated commercial loan; was signed on December 5; 2016 between the Angolan government and the ICBC-led consortium (ICBC; Exim; BoC; CCB; Minsheng; Ping An) for an amount of US$4.1B (4) (5). This figure was intended to finance 85% of the Caculo Cabaça contract cost. The loan has a 15-year term; it is available for drawdown until December 2022 and insured by China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) (4) (5). ICBC served as arranger; agent; and original lender.

On August 4; 2017; Angolan president José Eduardo dos Santos officially launched construction of the Caculo Cabaça project (6). Eximbank reportedly provided US$78M as an “advance payment guarantee” on December 19; 2017 (7). At this point; however; Caculo Cabaça underwent a series of changes stemming from the September 2017 inauguration of Joao Lourenço; dos Santos’ successor as president. Lourenço briefly delayed construction on the project while he took steps to end the dos Santos family’s involvement with Caculo Cabaça and reduce Angola’s dependence on Chinese credit (8). To these ends; Lourenço revoked the tender of Angolan contractor Niara; a firm strongly associated with Isabel dos Santos; forcing its removal from the CGGC-led JV; and reduced the loan amount from ICBC and the Chinese banking consortium to US$3.7B (8) (9).

To further diversify financing for Caculo Cabaça; Lourenço issued a presidential order on March 12; 2018 authorizing the signature of a second loan facility for the plant; this time between Angola and a German-led banking consortium; worth EUR 1.06B (approx. US$1.4B) (10). Angolan state media confirmed in February 2020 that the German credit agreement had been signed (11). The hydropower plant is financed by both the Chinese and German lines of credit — Chinese funds will be used for construction and transport systems; while German funds now cover the portion of the contract involving supply and assembly of electromechanical equipment (9). This brings Caculo Cabaça’s total cost to at least US$5B.

The Angolan government audit office released documentation in July 2020 suggesting that it is investigating the Caculo Cabaça hydropower project in some capacity (12). As of December 2020; construction of the plant was 4.1% complete (9). Portions of the project financed by Chinese credit include a temporary river diversion tunnel; primary construction of the hydropower facility; and the installation and testing of hydro- and electro-mechanical components (1) (13). The total installed capacity of Caculo Cabaça will be 2170 MW; which represents a projected increase to Angola’s power supply of nearly 50% — enough to enable it to export electricity to Namibia and South Africa (1) (14). It will be the fourth of seven planned hydroelectric dams on the Kwanza river (14).

"AO.063","Implementation",2016,"Angola","Government","Eximbank","Loan",932,,,5,"15","Caio Port in Cabinda & Sinosure Premium","Transport","China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2016; the government of Angola signed a US$932M loan agreement with China Eximbank to fund construction and pay Sinosure insurance premiums for the Caio port in Cabinda. This project is contracted to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Construction began in 2015 and was still ongoing as of 2020.

The Caio Port project was first conceived in 2007 (1). In 2012; after a five-year “investment period;” the Caio Port Company (Caioporto S.A.) was incorporated as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) for the sole purpose of developing and building Caio Port (2) (3). It immediately secured the Angolan Ministry of Transport contract for the design; financing; construction; and operation of the port (1) (2). In 2014; Caioporto entered into a public-private partnership (PPP) with the Angolan government to carry out the project (1) (4). All these developments were spearheaded by wealthy Swiss-Angolan entrepreneur Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais; who was then a “major shareholder” in Caioporto S.A. and the Caio Port project as a whole (1); and who also happened to manage 85% of the assets of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola; FSDEA) (2).

Construction of the port began in June 2015; when Caioporto S.A.; South African contractor Franki Africa; and local Angolan authorities launched construction of its preliminary infrastructure (5). Chinese financing came into play on February 3; 2016; when CRBC and Caioporto signed the US$831;994;725.75 commercial contract for primary construction of the port (6) (7). Angolan officials stated that they expected Eximbank to finance US$707;195;516.89 (85%) of the contract and Caioporto to provide the remaining US$124;799;208.86 (15%); with Caioporto then receiving full management authority over the port after a certain number of years (7) (8). The final loan agreement between Angola and Eximbank was signed on November 29; 2016 for a larger sum of US$932M; which covers 85% of the contract cost as well as 85% of the premium for the loan’s Sinosure export credit insurance policy (3). The loan facility has a 15-year maturity but was undrawn as of November 2019 (3).

The structure of Caioporto and the port project as a whole began to change after Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais came under investigation for “mismanagement” (2). In January 2017; other factions in the FSDEA began efforts to take ownership of Caioporto S.A from Bastos de Morais. The Fund invested US$180M to acquire a partial stake in Capoinvest Limited BVI; Caioporto’s parent entity (2) (9). After João Lourenço became president of Angola in September 2017; he accelerated the removal of Bastos de Morais from the Caio Port and its associated entities. Bastos de Morais was fired from his position at the FSDEA in April 2018 “under suspicion of harmful management” (10); and on May 30 Lourenço authorized a commission via presidential order to negotiate the termination of Caioporto S.A.’s contracts with CRBC and the Angolan government (2). This halted construction of the port (11).

By 2019; however; Lourenço’s government had managed to sever Bastos de Morais’s ties to the project without terminating Caioporto’s contracts. In October 2019; after Bastos de Morais allegedly reached some kind of deal to hand over control of Caioporto S.A. to the government; the FSDEA announced that it had acquired 100% of the company (4). Lourenço issued another presidential order that canceled his previous order to terminate Caioporto’s contracts (12). The new order reaffirmed Caioporto’s status as the contractor and supervisor of Caio Port and stated that the Chinese credit line would be “operationalized” to enable its implementation; but it also stipulated that Caioporto would no longer be granted management of the port after its completion. It will instead hand over the finished facility to the Port Company of Cabinda. Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus further clarified that the Angolan government had “assumed approximately 85 per cent. of the debt of the works contract signed between Caio Porto and the China Road and Bridge Corporation for the construction of a new port at Caio” (3); confirming that the government is now liable for the Eximbank loan after its acquisition of Caioporto.


Construction restarted a few months later; in January 2020 (11). According to the original Caioporto website; plans for the Caio Port include; among other specifications; a 630 m commercial quay; a trestle bridge and dam to access the port terminal; a 180 m access channel; new access roads; state-of-the-art gantry cranes and container handling equipment; a 1;130 m berth that will accommodate simultaneous docking of 4 large vessels; and a 200 m access channel (13). Construction of the port will be divided into two phases.

The Cazenga/Sambizanga loan was part of a US$1.3B credit line that Angola signed with CDB in 2009 (1). Projects were financed by entering into individual facility agreements under the credit line’s common terms agreement. The facility had expired by June 2015 (2). The total cost of the Cazenga/Sambizanga project; financed by CDB; was estimated to be AOA 12;323;348;634 (approx. US$130M) (1). Work on Cazenga and Sambizanga’s requalified infrastructure began in 2011 and was projected to continue until 2013 over a total period of 36 months (1).

(CICI)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2011; CITIC Construction Co.; Ltd. (CICI) began developing the Pedras Negras farm near the city of Melanje in Angola (1). The US$117M loan that financed the project originated from a US$1.3B Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola signed with China Development Bank (CDB) in 2009 (1)(2). In 2016; all shares in the farm went to Angola’s Sovereign Fund (3)(4).
 
On November 9; 2009; the Government of Angola and CDB signed a US$1.5B Master Framework Agreement; US$1.3 of which was disbursed (2). Unlike a number of other lines of credit extended to Angola by Chinese banks; this CDB facility was not backed by oil (5). Negotiations for the facility began in 2008 and ran concurrently with negotiations for two other lines of credit; a US$6B agreement with China Eximbank and a US$2.5B agreement with ICBC; which were also signed in 2009 (5). Under the CDB Master Framework Agreement; the Government of Angola and CDB concluded individual loan agreements for approved projects in the areas of social housing; agriculture; roads and railways; schools and hospitals; water and energy production; transportation; and telecommunications. Each of these individual loan agreements was for a different amount and the terms of the agreements varied. The projects themselves were carried out by pre-approved contractors. The availability of the line of credit expired on June 30; 2015; at which time US$1.2B had been disbursed and approximately US$100M was still awaiting disbursement (2). As of December 31; 2017; US$613.5M was outstanding under this facility (6). A year later this amount had decreased to US$391.7M (7).
 
The 12580-hectare Pedras Negras farm was the largest of six farm projects that were financed by the CDB line of credit. The farm projects were intended as a means to increase Angola’s self-reliance in terms of food production. Even with the addition of these and other agricultural projects; Angola; in 2015; produced only 40% of the grain it consumed and 1.8 million Angolans faced the threat of food insecurity (1). The Pedras Negras farm produces corn (22000 t); soybeans (6400 t); beans (4800 t) and corn flour (15600 t) (8).
 
Pedras Negras and the other farms supported by the CDB line of credit were operated under a similar model. The Angolan Ministry of Agriculture; represented by the state-owned company Gesterra; concluded an agreement with CICI; under which the Chinese company was responsible for developing the farm for a period of 3 years and training locals for an additional 2 years. During this 5-year period the Ministry of Agriculture retained full ownership of the farm and harvests were handed over to the Angolan Government (1). Originally; the farms were to be handed over to Gesterra after development and training had been completed; but this arrangement was amended after CICI’s 5-year contract elapsed in 2016. A presidential order; issued on May 4; 2016 by Angola’s then President Jose Eduardo; authorized Angola’s Sovereign Fund to hold all shares in the Pedras Negras farm (3).

A decree issued by the former Angolan President; Jose Eduardo dos Santos; on May 4; 2016; awarded all the shares in Sanza Pombo; and other farms; to the Sovereign Fund of Angola (FSDEA); which; at the time; was managed by the President’s son; Filomeno Dos Santos (8)(3). The FSDEA tasked the company Sociedade da Cakayama; SA; with operating the farm (3). A press report that claims that the FSDEA subcontracted the operation of six farms to five companies that were all founded in 2015 and headquartered in the same building; suggested that the process that had led to the awarding of these concessions was of dubious legality. President Dos Santos’ successor; Joao Lourenco; exonerated the former President’s son from his position at the FSDEA and put the concessions for Sanza Pombo; and other farms that had previously been managed by companies subcontracted by the FSDEA; out to tender in 2018 (3).

(CICI)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2010; Angola’s parastatal oil company; Sonangol; signed a US$2.5B commercial loan agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for the construction of Phase I of the Kilamba Kiaxi New City (1). Contractor CITIC Construction Co.; Ltd. (CICI) completed the project in 2012 (2).
 
A Housing shortage was among the major challenges that Angola faced after its civil war ended in 2002. President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos’ response to the crisis was a promise to construct 1 million houses; a program for which a total of 100000 hectares of land around Luanda and other major cities in Angola was reserved (3). Plans for Phase I of the Kilamba Kiaxi New City; located 20 km outside of Luanda; involved the construction of 710 buildings; or 20000 apartments; spread over an area of 5 km/sq. Supporting infrastructure included two high voltage transformers; 77 power sub-stations; 400 km of water pipes; a sewage plant; traffic lights; and bus stops (3).
 
Initially; funding for the Kilamba Kiaxi New City was supposed to have been provided by the China International Fund (CIF); a private investment fund headquartered in Hong Kong (3). ICBC took on the task of financing the project when CIF ran into financial difficulties. The loan has a term of 8 years and is guaranteed by oil sales to Unipec; a subsidiary of China’s parastatal oil company; Sinopec (1)(3). Sonip; Sonangol’s real estate subsidiary; was in charge of marketing the apartments and the proceeds of these sales were used to repay the loan (4). The Pierson Capital Group oversaw the project. Payments to CICI were structured in such a way that they flowed directly from ICBC to the contractor and bypassed the Angolan Government’s balance sheet (3).
 
CICI signed the construction contract for Phase I of the Kilamba Kiaxi New City in 2007 and completed construction in 2012 (2). Following completion of the project; the Kilamba Kiaxi New City was decried as a ghost town by various news outlets and paraded as an example of Chinese excess (3)(4). Contrary to this myth; the housing development did begin to fill with new residents after getting off to a slow start. By 2014; 40000 people had moved into apartments in Kilamba (4).

This US$2B loan agreement was one of four loan agreements that Sonangol signed with CDB between 2011 and 2014 (for the other three see: AO.081; AO.082; AO.083). The loan had a term of 9.33 years and was in repayment in 2013 (1).
 
The four CDB loans had a combined value of US$7.5B and were taken out before the oil price fell in 2015. Following the decline in oil prices; Sonangol faced mounting pressure to repay these loans (3). In 2015; the Government of Angola and CDB concluded a US$15B Master Framework Agreement for various infrastructure projects and “prepaying certain facilities between Sonangol and CDB and financing certain of Sonangol’s strategic projects” (2). In 2016; Sonangol refinanced existing loans with US$10B in disbursements from this facility (see AO.089.96). The funds flowed from CDB; to the Government of Angola; and finally went to Sonangol. In essence; the Government of Angola transferred Sonangol’s debt to CDB to its own balance sheet; decreasing Sonangol’s external debt; while increasing its own external debt to CDB (3).

The Sonaref plant; located near the city of Lobito; is reported to be one of the projects financed by this loan (2). The project is supposed to decrease Angola’s reliance on refined product imports (2)(5). Construction activities at the site of the Sonaref refinery began in 2012 and the plant was initially supposed to be commissioned in 2017/18 (2). News reports from July 2021; however; indicate that the project has been stalled. In July 2021; Angola was seeking investors for the unfinished project and proposing a corporate governance structure that would allow private investors to own a 70% stake in the refinery; with Sonangol controlling the remaining 30% (5).

The individual facilities for projects under the master agreement financed up to 85% of the relevant contract prices. Funds under this framework were used for projects within an approved list of infrastructure sectors in Angola; including “housing; transportation; agriculture; roads and railways; hospitals; schools; telecommunication; water and electricity; sanitation and other human livelihood areas agreed by CDB and Angola” (1). The constituent loans were each worth at least US$10M and have 10-year terms. As of December 31; 2018; US$300.5M was outstanding under the master facility; meaning that US$2.2B had been drawn down (2).

Funding for this project came from a US$15B Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and China Development Bank (CDB) signed on December 9; 2015 (3). While details on the actual loan amount are scarce; we assume the loan financed 85% (US$452M) of the US$532M construction contract; similar to the other loans originating from the CDB line of credit. The project was completed in 2019 (4).
 
According to an Angolan bond prospectus issued in 2018; the Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and CDB entered into on December 9; 2015 was for an oil-backed pre-payment facility. The line of credit extended by CDB financed various approved projects in Angola and provided funding for Angola’s parastatal oil company; Sonangol. A separate oil contract stipulated the terms for repayment of the loan; which is being made through oil “receivables.” The loan has a term of 12 years and; by the time its availability expired on December 9; 2017; the facility had been drawn in full. Repayment began in 2018. Angola’s outstanding debt to CDB was US$14.9B as of December 2018 and US$14.5B as of June 30; 2019 (3). Press reports from 2020 indicated that; at the time; CDB was Angola’s largest individual creditor (5).
 
The Master Framework Agreement came with a list of 37 “recommended” Chinese contractors “pre-qualified” for bidding on contracts associated with the loan (6)(7). Critics of this approach pointed out that the preferential treatment of Chinese contractors would likely do little to stimulate job creation or knowledge transfer within Angola. The Government of Angola responded to its critics by negotiating a compromise; according to which 20% of the contract value of the projects associated with the CDB loan had to be subcontracted to local businesses (7).
 
On May 25; 2016; four Presidential orders approved four projects related to electrification; all of which were financed by the CDB line of credit and contracted to Chinese companies (2). Sinohydro’s US$532 contract for the province of Luanda; which included 9 substations; 1000 transformers; and various overhead and underground cables; was the largest of these contracts (8). Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony for the Belo Monte substation on September 8; 2016; attended by Joao Baptista Borges; Angola’s Minister of Water and Energy; Higino Carneiro; Governor of Luanda; and Wang Yuzhi; General Manager of Sinohydro Angola (9). Construction was completed in 2019. At the ceremony for the handover of the Belo Monte Substation; Minister of Water and Energy; Joao Baptista Borges; emphasized that the project had brought electricity to 300 000 homes in Luanda and benefitted approximately 2.5 million people (4).

The Presidential order that was issued on May 26; 2016; approved the contract under which CMEC was tasked with connecting the Huamba province of Angola with the Lauca dam; which is currently under construction (7). This link between the power-rich northern region of Angola and the undersupplied southern and central regions of the country aimed at stabilizing the power supply and promoting development in these inland regions (8)(3). The project included plans for 398 km of transmission lines and three substations (3). On May 9; 2017; Angola’s Minister of Energy and Water; Jaoa Baptista Borges; attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Dango substation in the city of Huambo (8). On April 3; 2019; the Dango station was energized; marking the completion of the Lauca-Huambo transmission system (3).

Under its US$72M lot 1 contract; Sinohydro was tasked with constructing a capture; treatment; transmission and reservoir system for Huambo City (7). The US$91M lot 2 contract included plans for the construction of three distribution centers; a pumping station; various reservoirs; and a 315 km distribution network with 21000 household connections (7). Documents released in 2016 by Angola’s Court of Auditor’s show that Sinohydro guaranteed “exact and timely fulfillment” of its lot 1 contract with a US$7.2M (10% of the lot 1 contract value) bank guarantee; issued by the Bank of China (8). Construction began in 2016 and ended on November 8; 2020; with a ceremony attended by Angola’s Minister of Water and Energy; Joao Baptista Borges; the Governor of Huambo province and other local officials (3).

Funding for this project came from a US$15B Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and China Development Bank (CDB) signed on December 9; 2015 (2). While details on the actual loan amount are scarce; we assume the loan financed 85% (US$188M) of the US$221.8M construction contract; similar to the other loans originating from the CDB line of credit.  The project has been implemented; but its current status is unclear (3).

The Government of Angola responded to its critics by negotiating a compromise according to which 20% of the contract value of the projects associated with the CDB loan had to be subcontracted to local businesses (6).
 
The Presidential Order that approved the contract for the rehabilitation of the Cabolongo-Cacuaco Expressway was originally issued on September 5; 2016 (1). Altogether; the order approved three contracts for the rehabilitation of roads that will serve as access roads for Luanda International Airport. The three projects had a combined value of US$692.7M and were all contracted to CR-20. On October 3; 2016; the order that approved the contracts was revoked on the grounds that the projects were not a priority. The October 3 order was revoked on November 14; 2016; and the three construction contracts were reinstated (1). Like the roads that will connect it with the rest of the country; the Luanda International Airport is financed by Chinese loans and is being built by Chinese contractors. Under construction for more than a decade; the Airport and its supporting infrastructure are reported to have cost US$6.4B (8).

A report issued by the Parliament of Angola on August 30; 2018; lists a substantial portion of the contract value of the Cabolongo-Cacuaco Expressway as an expense incurred during the fiscal year 2017 (3). From this it can be deduced that the project has been implemented; although it is unclear whether or not the project has been completed.

"AO.089.81","Implementation",2016,"Angola","Government","CDB","MFA-sub",156,,,,,"Rehabilitation of EN230; with Connection to the Unidade Operativa Overpass; and Improvements of the Luanda-Viana VIA Expressway","Transport","China Railway 20th Bureau Group Co.; Ltd. (CR-20)","Oil Exports","NARRATIVE: On November 14; 2016; a Presidential order issued by Angola's then president; Jose Eduardo Dos Santos; approved a US$183M contract between the Government of Angola and China Railway 20th Bureau Group Co. ltd (CR-20) for the rehabilitation of a 25 km stretch of the EN230 highway (1). Funding for this project came from a US$15B Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and China Development Bank (CDB) signed on December 9; 2015 (2). While details on the actual loan amount are scarce; we assume the loan financed 85% (US$156M) of the US$183M construction contract; similar to the other loans originating from the CDB line of credit. The project has been implemented; but its current status is unclear (3).
 
According to an Angolan bond prospectus issued in 2018; the Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and CDB entered into on December 9; 2015; was for an oil-backed pre-payment facility. The line of credit extended by CDB financed various approved projects in Angola and provided funding for Angola’s parastatal oil company; Sonangol. A separate oil contract stipulated the terms for repayment of the loan; which is being made through oil “receivables”. The loan has a term of 12 years and; by the time its availability expired on December 9; 2017; the facility had been drawn in full. Repayment began in 2018. Angola’s outstanding debt to CDB was US$14.9B as of December 2018 and US$14.5B as of June 30; 2019 (2). Press reports from 2020 indicated that; at the time; CDB was Angola’s largest individual creditor (4).

The Master Framework Agreement came with a list of 37 “recommended” Chinese contractors “pre-qualified” for bidding on contracts associated with the loan (5)(6). Critics of this approach pointed out that the preferential treatment of Chinese contractors would likely do little to stimulate job creation or knowledge transfer within Angola. The Government of Angola responded to its critics by negotiating a compromise according to which 20% of the contract value of the projects associated with the CDB loan had to be subcontracted to local businesses (6).
 
The Presidential Order that approved the contract for the rehabilitation of the 25 km stretch of EN230 was originally issued on September 5; 2016 (1). Altogether; the order approved three contracts for the rehabilitation of roads that will serve as access roads for Luanda International Airport. The three projects had a combined value of US$692.7M and were all contracted to CR-20 (1). On October 3; 2016; the order that approved the contracts was revoked on the grounds that the projects were not a priority. The October 3 order was revoked on November 14; 2016; and the three construction contracts were reinstated (1). Like the roads that will connect it with the rest of the country; the Luanda International Airport is financed by Chinese loans and is being built by Chinese contractors. Under construction for more than a decade; the Airport and its supporting infrastructure are reported to have cost US$6.4B (8).

A report issued by the Parliament of Angola on August 30; 2018; lists a substantial portion of the contract value for the 25 km stretch of EN230 as an expense incurred during the fiscal year 2017 (3). From this it can be deduced that the project has been implemented; although it is unclear whether or not the project has been completed.

During an inspection of the unfinished 34 km stretch of EN230; Angola’s Minister of Finance; Archer Mangueira; provided some insight into the disbursement process for the loan associated with the project. Mangueira explained that the Government of Angola had paid 15% of the contract value and he now expected disbursement to begin. Disbursement; he continued; would follow the submission of invoices by the contractor (3). Though this press release shows that construction of the 34 km stretch of EN230 was underway in August 2017; it is unclear when construction began and whether or not the project has been completed. Construction time was originally estimated at 9 months (3).

(CHEC) for the construction of lot 2 of Sumbe City’s integrated infrastructure project (1). 85%; or US$106M; of this contract was financed by a commercial loan from the Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (1).
 
The Presidential Order from March 2017 approved a total of three contracts; with a combined value of US$459; for three lots of infrastructure construction in Sumbe City; the capital of Cuanza Sul province (2). Lots 1 and 2 were contracted to CHEC and lot 3 was awarded to CHEC’s owner; Sinohydro. Lot 2 included plans for the construction of drainage works; the rehabilitation of 13 km of streets; and the renovation of public lighting and telecommunications networks (3). The Sumbe City infrastructure project aimed to address Sumbe City’s deficits in regard to mobility; access to clean water; and basic sanitation. Press reports indicate that the city of 200000 inhabitants had become known for its problem with dust and the health consequences that resulted from this problem (3).
 
Construction of lot 2 commenced on February 20; 2019; approximately three months after lot 1 began to be implemented (3). A press report from November 2019; claimed that 24% of the work on lot 2 had been executed and estimated that construction would be completed by August 2020 (3). Angola’s Minister of Public Works and Spatial Planning; Manuel Tavares de Alameida; visited the lot 2 construction site in December 2020 and told reporters that 37% of the work on lot 2 had been carried out and that he expected completion of lot 2 in 2022 (4). At the time of the minister’s visit; lot 3 was still awaiting funding. The minister explained that the Chinese line of credit that was supposed to finance lot 3 had “not been activated” and that the Angolan Government was seeking an alternative financier (4).

The loan was used to recapitalize Sonangol.
 
According to an Angolan bond prospectus issued in 2018; the Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and CDB entered into on December 9; 2015; was for an oil-backed pre-payment facility. Beyond the recapitalization of Sonangol; the line of credit extended by CDB also financed various approved infrastructure projects in Angola.

Angola’s outstanding debt to CDB was US$14.9B as of December 2018 and US$14.5B as of June 30; 2019 (1).
 
By the time the price of oil declined in 2015; Sonangol had borrowed around US$7.5B from CDB (2)(3). The 2016 US$10B disbursements that flowed from CDB; to the Government of Angola; and then to Sonangol; were used to refinance these existing loans (3). In essence; the Government of Angola transferred Sonangol’s debt to CDB to its own balance sheet; decreasing Sonangol’s external debt; while increasing its own external debt to CDB by US$10B (3). Press reports from 2020 indicated that; at the time; CDB was Angola’s largest individual creditor (4).

(CGGC)",,"NARRATIVE: On September 27; 2013; a Presidential Order issued by Angola's then president; Jose Eduardo dos Santos; approved a US$210M contract between Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water and China Gezhouba Group Company ltd. (CGGC) for the expansion and rehabilitation of the Luachimo hydroelectric dam (1)(2). 85%; or US$180M; of this contract was financed by a commercial loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (1). Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2021 (3).
 
Under its contract with Angola’s Ministry of Energy and Water; CGGC was tasked with increasing the capacity of the Luachimo hydroelectric dam; which was built in the 1950’s; from 8 to 36 MW and rehabilitating 9 defunct electrical substations (1). Located near Dundo in the eastern part of Lunda Norte Province; the modernized and expanded Luachimo dam is expected to provide power for 10000 households in the region (4).
 
In 2014; the Portuguese company COBA was contracted to prepare the implementation of the project and provide special technical assistance related to the dam’s electromechanical and electrical equipment (1). Also in 2014; the company EFACEC received a US$83M contract for supplying generating equipment from CGGC’s subcontractor; NIARA Power (1). This decision came under scrutiny when a 2017 article by Maka Angola revealed the identity of the alleged owner of NIARA Power and EFACEC. The article claimed that Jose Eduardo Dos Santos daughter; Isabel Dos Santos; was the majority shareholder in EFACEC and the owner of NIARA Power’s parent company; Niara Holdings (5).
 
On October 13; 2016; Joao Baptista Borges; Angola’s Minister of Energy and Water; Ernesto Muangala; Governor of Lunda Norte Province; and Shang Jianping; General Manager of the Luachimo Project Department at CGGC; attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Luachimo hydroelectric dam project (6). The project was to be completed within 37 months (6). A press report from August 2020 indicated that implementation of the project; which began in 2018; had slowed down due to the outbreak of Coronavirus (3). Initially scheduled for completion in 2020; the expected date of completion was pushed to the first half of 2021. At the time; an official at the Ministry of Energy and Water estimated that around 60% of the work had been completed (3).

"AO.089.97","Signed",2016,"Angola","Government","CDB","Loan",386,,,,,"Package S5- Quilonga Grande Construction","Water","Sinohydro Ltd.",,"NARRATIVE: In 2016; a series of Presidential Orders approved 7 contracts with a combined value of US$454M between the Government of Angola and Sinohydro (1). Under these contracts Sinohydro was tasked with constructing 7 lots of the Quilonga Grande water supply project. Funding for this project came from a US$15B Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and China Development Bank (CDB) signed on December 9; 2015 (2). The loan financed 85% (US$386M) of the combined value of these contracts (3). The project has been implemented; but its current status is unclear (3).
 
According to an Angolan bond prospectus issued in 2018; the Master Framework Agreement that the Government of Angola and CDB entered into on December 9; 2015; was for an oil-backed pre-payment facility.

Angola’s outstanding debt to CDB was US$14.9B as of December 2018 and US$14.5B as of June 30; 2019 (2). Press reports from 2020 indicated that; at the time; CDB was Angola’s largest individual creditor (4).

The Master Framework Agreement came with a list of 37 “recommended” Chinese contractors “pre-qualified” for bidding on contracts associated with the loan (5)(6). Critics of this approach pointed out that the preferential treatment of Chinese contractors would likely do little to stimulate job
creation or knowledge transfer within Angola. The Government of Angola responded to its critics by negotiating a compromise according to which 20% of the contract value of the projects associated with the CDB loan had to be subcontracted to local businesses (6).
 
In 2012; the Government of Angola completed a water supply masterplan that called for the construction of two new water supply systems; Bita (S4) and Quilonga Grande (S5); to meet the water demand of greater Luanda (3). Once completed; the Quilonga Grande water supply system will move approximately 500000 tons of water a day and benefit 3.45 million people in and around Luanda (7). Over the course of the year 2016 Sinohydro was contracted for lots Q1; Q3; Q4; Q5; Q8; Q9; and Q10 of the Quilonga Grande project; while the number of contractors involved in the project decreased. The US$347M Q1 contract for example; the most valuable of the Quilonga contracts; was initially awarded to “a consortium formed by the companies OTV International; Griner Engenharia; SA; and Sinohydro Corporation; Limited” by a Presidential Order dated January 25; 2016 (8). On August 4; 2016; another Presidential Order released OTV and Griner from their contracts and assigned their responsibilities to Sinohydro (9). Contracts for other lots of Quilonga saw a similar reduction in participating contractors as the year 2016 progressed (8)(10).
 
In April 2017; Angola’s Minister of Energy and Water Resources; Joao Baptista Borges; and Luanda’s Governor; Higino Lopes Carneiro; attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Quilonga water supply system (7). A World Bank report from 2019 noted that commissioning of the works for the Quilonga project had not yet been scheduled (3).

(GHCB) for the construction of the Luanda Water Distribution Network (1). 85%; or US$130M; of this contract was financed by an Export Buyer’s Credit provided by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) (1)(2). GHCB completed construction of the Luanda Water Supply Network in 2016 (3).
 
Under the terms of its agreement with the Government of Angola; GHCB was tasked with the construction of an 842 km network of pipes and the installation of 416000 household connections in the Municipality of Cazenga and the Districts of Rangel; Ingombota; Samba; and Maianga (1)(4). At the time the project was conceived; most households in Luanda had no access to running water and most of the city’s 5.17 million residents relied on water trucks and centralized water supply points for their water needs (3).
 
According to a GHCB employee involved in the Luanda Water Supply Network; the company was first contracted for the project in 2011 and began construction in 2012. Funding for the project initially came from Angola’s national budget; but GHCB was forced to abandon work when the contracting agency ran out of funds. GHCB then sought an alternative financing arrangement on behalf of the contracting agency; which it secured through ICBC. The Presidential Order that (re)awarded the commercial contract for the Luanda Water Supply Network to GHCB also authorized Angola’s Minister of Finance to enter into the US$130M Export Buyer’s Credit agreement that finally secured the necessary funding for the project (1). Work on the Luanda Water Supply Network resumed in 2014 and was completed in 2016 (3).

Contractor CITIC Construction Co. ltd. (CICI) began construction in 2011 (2).
 
An Angolan 10-year urban development plan focused on promoting tourism; included a three stage plan for the construction of a tourist resort at Futungo De Belas; an area of 537 hectares located on the outskirts of Angola’s capital; Luanda. In addition to housing for 50000 people; the project called for the construction of sporting and trade facilities as well as supporting infrastructure in the form of sanitation; electricity; and drinking water. According to press reports; the project was estimated to cost US$150M (3). CICI was tasked with implementing the project (2).
 
President Dos Santos personally attended the groundbreaking ceremony for phase I of the Futungo De Bela project on July 11; 2011 (2). The ICBC loan was approved more than three years after construction began and a 2019 report indicated that funding for the project ran out sometime between the loan signing and 2019 (4). CICI was forced to suspend construction and it is unclear whether or not work on the project ever resumed. The contractor’s website states that “all on-site construction tasks” have been completed; but the status of the project as a whole is unknown (2).

Construction was completed in 2017 (3).
 
Although it is unclear when construction of the Nzeto-Soyo road first began; media sources indicate that work on the road was suspended for six years between 2010 and 2016; due to a lack of funds (4)(5). In February 2016; approximately five months after the Government of Angola signed the loan agreement with China Eximbank; the Governor of Zaire Province; Jose Joanes Andre; inspected the project and announced that the financial problems that had caused the delay had been solved. He confirmed that the conclusion of a new loan agreement with China had secured the necessary funding for the project and that construction would soon resume (4).
 
On August 17; 2017; Angola’s Vice President; Manuel Vicente; opened the Nzeto-Soyo road; though construction on one of the lanes of the road was still ongoing at the time. Angola’s Minister of Construction; Artur Fortunato; attended the ceremony (3). As of December 31; 2018; Angola’s outstanding debt under the China Eximbank facility was US334M (1).

The project was contracted to Sinohydro. Construction began in 2009 and concluded in 2011.

The Fiftieth Anniversary Hospital loan is part of a 2008 infrastructure credit line extended to the DRC by Eximbank through the “Sicomines” program (the infrastructure portion is simply called the Sino-Congolese Program) (1). This loan facility; estimated to have disbursed over US$1B total since its inception; is tied to another even larger credit line aimed at helping a consortium of Chinese and Congolese companies develop and operate a large copper mine in the DRC (1). Sicomines infrastructure loans are therefore effectively backed by copper exports — the whole arrangement is described as a “barter deal” involving the exchange of minerals for infrastructure projects (1). There are few official details available on the terms of these loans; but Chinese parties to the Sicomines agreement have committed to cover the difference if Eximbank interest rates rise above 4.4% (1). The Sino-Congolese Program is supervised by the DRC’s Congolese Agency of Public Works (ACGT).

The Chinese loan for the hospital was the final chapter in a long and troubled project history. The first stone was technically laid in 1954; but construction was interrupted by Congolese independence in 1960; and the construction site took on various names and purposes throughout the 1970s (2). It continued to stall until; under the auspices of Sicomines; the DRC borrowed US$114;879;516.42 in 2008 to complete the project and rebrand it as the Fiftieth Anniversary Hospital (3). Sinohydro started construction on the hospital in 2009 and had finished the structure by 2011 (2); at the end of 2012; however; its opening was reportedly still on hold because it was “awaiting a staffing arrangement” (1). The facility was finally inaugurated on March 22; 2014 after it was determined that it would be operated by Padiyath Healthcare; an Indian corporation (2).

The project is contracted to Sinohydro. Construction began in 2012 and concluded in 2018.

Zongo II; which has an installed capacity of 150 MW; is the “second phase” of an older and smaller hydropower plant originally completed in 1955 (1). The newer Zongo facility has twice the capacity of its predecessor and is intended to relieve pressure on the DRC power grid stemming from Zongo I’s state of disrepair. The commercial contract with Sinohydro for Zongo II was signed in 2009 (2). On January 29; 2011; Chinese and Congolese officials signed a US$367.5M loan agreement to finance the project (3); an amount that represents 100% of its cost (1).

Construction began on May 16; 2012 (4). Sinohydro originally intended to finish the project by 2015; but construction was suspended from November 2014 to the first quarter of 2016 due to SNEL’s (Société Nationale D’Électricité; the state electricity company) failure to keep up with Eximbank loan payments (2). After another disagreement between SNEL and Sinohydro; this time over hydraulic data (2); the Zongo II plant was completed and its official inauguration took place on June 22; 2018 (4).

(WIETC)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2019; the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) signed a US$301M concessional loan agreement with China Eximbank to fund the construction of a new terminal for the N’Djili International Airport in Kinshasa. The project is contracted to a subsidiary of Weihai International Economic and Technical Cooperative (WIETC). A ceremony was held in 2018 to launch construction; but progress has stalled since then; and the terminal’s prospects are unclear.

On September 16; 2013; the DRC Air Transit Authority (RVA) and WIETC signed a commercial contract for the new N’Djili terminal (1). The original contract value has been reported at amounts varying from US$354.2M (2) to US$364.9M (1). Construction was officially launched on May 20; 2018 under the assumption that Eximbank would finance approximately 85% of the cost (3). The DRC and Eximbank subsequently signed a loan agreement in 2019 for an amount of US$301.098M; with terms as follows: a 2% interest rate; 7-year grace period; and 13-year repayment period (4).

These basic details are the only widely agreed and officially confirmed components of the N’Djili project. As of late 2020; there was no credible confirmation that construction on the project had continued beyond the May 2018 launch ceremony; or that Eximbank had begun disbursing any of the loan funds. A number of rumors and controversies have also circulated around the terminal. First; local news outlets have alleged that RVA; fearing that the DRC would not be able to pay its portion of the contract; entered into a joint venture with WIETC so the contractor could pay 15% of the cost (approx. US$53M) in the DRC government’s stead (2). WIETC supposedly contributed US$20M to the terminal before backing out and “annulling” the JV.

Second; local reporters and politicians have accused the DRC government of corruption and misuse of loan funds. One politician claimed in 2020 that US$20M (the same amount ostensibly contributed by WIETC) had been spent on a scale model of the terminal and an elaborate construction launch ceremony; but that there had been no real construction progress since 2018 (5). Local media reports as of June 2020 suggest that disbursements had not started because RVA has not been able to provide its 15% share of financing (2).

The DRC signed a US$298.88M loan agreement with Eximbank for the Kinsuka substation on October 28; 2018 (1). The loan carries a 2% interest rate; 7-year grace period; and 13-year repayment period (2). DRC government sources note that this was the country’s only source of new bilateral foreign debt in 2018. Shanghai Electric and Sinohydro began work on the substation in November 2019 and stated in 2020 that it will be completed by 2022; potentially due to COVID-19 pandemic-influenced delays (3).

Construction of the project; which was contracted to CMEC; began in 2005 and concluded in 2010.

On March 25; 2003; the ROC government and CMEC signed an agreement to finance 85% of the contract value of the Imboulou hydropower project; with the remaining 15% to be financed by the ROC (1). The total contract value was US$280M; the loan agreement was worth approximately US$238M. This facility was provided directly to CMEC by China Eximbank.; and CMEC used the funds to offer the loan as a supplier’s credit to the ROC government (1). The loan carried a 15-year maturity and 0.2% interest (2).

The Imboulou hydroelectric plant; comprising four turbine units and a gross capacity of 120 MW; began construction in June 2005 (4). A visiting Chinese and Congolese delegation confirmed its completion in 2010 (3). An inauguration and ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on May 7; 2011 (4). Work on the plant also involved the construction of a paved access road and hotel nearby (5).

Construction of the project; contracted to CMEC; was reportedly still ongoing as of 2019.

On December 19; 2005; in Brazzaville; the ROC government; represented by its Finance Minister; signed a US$551.507M supplier’s credit agreement with CMEC president Xie Biao for the construction of the network (1). The total contract value of the Imboulou energy transmission lines was US$648.832M; the supplier’s credit from CMEC represented 85% of that amount; with the ROC liable for the other 15%; or US$97.325M. The original loan term was 17 years; including a 5-year grace period and 12-year repayment period; and the interest rate was 0.2% (1). CMEC agreed to begin "preparatory work" on the project as soon as the first advance payment of the ROC’s portion of the project cost; due by January 31; 2006; was received.

In 2018; ROC and CMEC negotiated an amendment to the original loan contract that altered some of the loan terms. It changed the maturity to 20 years; this includes a grace period of 3.5 years and a repayment period of 16.5 years (1). As of April 13; 2018 – the amendment’s signature date – the ROC government had reimbursed US$207;876;503.54 (37.7%) of the original loan principal to CMEC. This restructuring agreement was ratified by the ROC Parliament on May 24; 2019 (1).

Construction plans include a transformer center; 756 km of 220Kv transmission lines; 91 km of 110Kv transmission lines; 18 towers of 30Kv each; and an additional 375 km total of 30Kv lines and 20Kv cables (2). There is little information available on exact construction dates or progress; but at the time of the loan restructuring agreement in 2019; some connections included in the transmission network plans reportedly had yet to be fully realized; including a line linking the Imboulou network to the village of Ewo (3). The restructuring agreement allowed construction to resume after a hiatus.

The project was contracted to China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC). Construction began in 2012 and concluded in 2017.

The loan for the Liouesso hydropower project originated as part of a second oil-backed credit line extended to the ROC by Eximbank in 2012 (1). This facility was a continuation of the original strategic partnership agreement signed in June 2006 (2). Like the 2006 credit line; the infrastructure loans under the 2012 agreement were borrowed on concessional terms: a 20-year maturity; including a 5-year grace period and 15-year repayment period; and a 0.25% interest rate (3). Also like the previous credit facility; the ROC was required to use profits from oil sales to China to maintain an escrow account balance with Eximbank equal to at least 20% of the total outstanding loan amount as additional security for this arrangement (3).

Chinese financing for the Liouesso plant amounted to US$105M (4). The project consisted of three 6.4 MW Francis units; for a total of 19.2 MW; along with power generation and power transmission facilities (5). The plant was built on the Lingoue river near the village of Liouesso; and is 85 km from the city of Ouesso; regional capital of Sangha (6). Construction was launched in 2012 by ROC President Denis Sassou-Nguesso; who once again visited the construction site in May 2015 to check on its progress (5). The plant was finally inaugurated in May 2017 (7).

Like the first phase; Phase II was contracted to China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Construction began in 2012 and concluded in 2015.

The loan for Phase II of the Owando-Makoua-Ouesso Road originated as part of a second oil-backed credit line extended to the ROC by Eximbank in 2012 (1). This facility was a continuation of the original 2006 strategic partnership agreement signed in June 2006 (2).

The total cost of RN2 Phase II was XAF 129B; or US$260M (4); and Eximbank provided XAF 116.409B; or approximately US$234M (5). The second phase covers the final 199 km of RN2; between Mambili and Ouésso (5). CRBC broke ground on Phase II on May 15; 2012; the very same day that the completion ceremony was held for the first phase (4). The completion ceremony for the second phase; and the highway as a whole; was held in July 2015 (6). As of November 2017; the ROC owed US$200M in outstanding loan balance for this project (1).

The project is contracted to Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG). Construction began in 2015 and was still ongoing as of 2020.

The loan for the Brazzaville Twin Towers project is a component of a second oil-backed credit line extended to the ROC by Eximbank in 2012 (1). This facility was a continuation of the original 2006 strategic partnership agreement (2). Like the 2006 credit line; the infrastructure loans under the 2012 agreement were borrowed on concessional terms: a 20-year maturity; including a 5-year grace period and 15-year repayment period; and a 0.25% interest rate (3). Also like the previous credit facility; the ROC was required to use profits from oil sales to China to maintain an escrow account balance with Eximbank equal to at least 20% of the total outstanding loan amount as additional security for this arrangement (3).

In June 2014; Eximbank President Li Ruogu and the ROC Minister of Finance signed loan agreements in Beijing to fund three projects in Mpila through the 2012 credit line; including the Twin Towers (4). The total contract value of the building is US$386M (5). With 85% financed by Eximbank; this gives us an approximate loan amount of US$328M (6). BCEG began construction on the Twin Towers commercial center in July 2015 (5). The loan agreement between the ROC and Eximbank for the project was formally ratified by the ROC Parliament on September 24; 2015 (7) following a visit to the construction site in August by members of the National Assembly’s Finance Committee (6).

The main structure of the towers was completed in August 2017 (8). However; work on the commercial center as a whole was apparently not yet complete; since it was later reported that construction of the project was put on hold due to the ROC’s 2017-2019 debt sustainability crisis (9). The crisis caused the ROC to restructure some of its debt to China. An April 2019 agreement with Eximbank modified the original terms of 8 loan contracts; including the loan for the Mpila twin towers; so that each one now has a 3-5 year grace period and 10-15 year repayment period (10). The text clarifies that; in practice; this arrangement prolongs the remaining maturity of each loan to 15 years from the date that the restructuring agreement goes into effect. The debt restructuring plan was a key stipulation for the ROC to enter into a program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to the signed agreement; the Mpila twin towers were 70% complete as of March 31; 2019 (10).

BCEG resumed construction in October 2020 (11). ROC officials noted in the 2019 restructuring agreement that they plan to ensure the profitability of the Twin Towers by creating a public-private partnership (PPP) to manage the buildings once they are complete (10). This strategy is meant to generate enough revenue to repay at least a portion of the loan. One of the two Twin Towers contains a hotel; the other contains office space (8). The commercial center will be the tallest building in the ROC (5).

The contract was awarded to Huawei. Work began in 2017 and was still ongoing as of June 2021.

The commercial contract for National Telecom Phase III; worth US$199;728;357.74; was first signed by the ROC and Huawei on July 15; 2015 (1). On May 20; 2017; ROC Finance Minister Calixte Nganongo and Eximbank Vice President Xie Ping signed a PEBC loan agreement to finance 80.55% of the project cost (2). The loan facility amounts to US$160;875;500 and carries a 2% interest rate; 5-year grace period; and 15-year repayment period (1). As part of the loan contract; the ROC is required to repay the principal; interest; and fees by depositing the revenue generated by the finished project in an escrow account with Eximbank (1). The contract was officially ratified by the ROC Senate and National Assembly on August 14; 2017 (1).

National Telecom Phase III is part of the ROC’s “Road to the Future” social development program. Upon its completion; Congo Telecom’s mobile and broadband networks will cover all 10 provinces and 6 municipalities across the country (2). Thanks to Huawei’s involvement; Congo Telecom is set to receive significant upgrades to its infrastructure; including 4G LTE technology; Chinese-supplied terminals; 30;000 FTTX fiber optic cables; technical assistance in taking over operation of the system from Huawei; and the construction and equipment of a new agency in Pointe-Noire to help manage the finished network (3).

There is little concrete information on the start date for the third phase of the national coverage project; but local sources imply that it began either shortly after the loan ratification in 2017 or later in 2018 (4). It was reported in September 2019 that construction on Phase III would be relaunched; suggesting that; like many other projects; the national telecoms upgrade was temporarily suspended due to the ROC’s 2017-2019 debt sustainability crisis (5). In a June 2021 meeting with ROC President Denis Sassou-Nguesso; Huawei executives reported that the project would be finished “soon” (6).

"CG.025","Implementation",2017,"Republic of Congo","Government","Eximbank","CL",154,"2",,5,"20","Digital Television Migration","ICT","StarTimes Group",,"NARRATIVE: In 2017; the government of the Republic of Congo (ROC) signed a US$154M concessional loan agreement with China Eximbank to fund a nationwide radio and television digitization project. The contract was awarded to StarTimes Group. Work began in 2017 and was still ongoing as of September 2019.

A commercial contract to “transform” the ROC’s analog radio and television systems into terrestrial digital radio and TV was first signed between the ROC and StarTimes Software Technology on July 15; 2015; for a total amount of US$161.63M (1). On January 18; 2017; China and the ROC signed a framework agreement on the provision of government interest-subsidized concessional loans from the PRC to the ROC (1); paving the way for the final concessional loan agreement; which was signed on May 20; 2017 by ROC Finance Minister Calixte Nganongo and Eximbank Vice President Xie Ping (2). The loan amount is CNY 998;873;400; or approximately US$154M at 2017 exchange rates (1). The text of the loan agreement states that this figure is intended to cover 100% of the commercial contract; so the discrepancy can most likely be attributed to exchange rates. The loan carries a 2% interest rate; 5-year grace period; and 15-year repayment period (1). The ROC’s Senate and National Assembly ratified the loan agreement on August 14; 2017 (1).

There are few concrete updates available on the digitization process. It was reported in September 2019 that construction on the analog-to-digital upgrade would be relaunched; suggesting that; like many other infrastructure projects; this project was temporarily suspended due to the ROC’s 2017-2019 debt sustainability crisis (3).

The loan constituted an export buyer’s credit covering 85% of the total contract cost of US$497M; with the remaining 15% to be paid by the Cameroonian government. Construction was completed by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC) on April 6; 2015 (2).

On January 12; 2011; Cameroonian Minister of Economy; Planning; and Regional Development Luis Paul Motaze announced that; following meetings with Eximbank chairman Li Ruogu in Yaoundé; agreement had been reached on a loan deal to be signed later that week (3). According to reporting; the port; intended for use in shipping iron ore; aluminum; cobalt; and nickel produced by mining operations; was projected to cost XAF 282 billion; with the Eximbank loan covering XAF 207 billion. The specifics of the loan included a maturity period of 20.5 years (mistakenly listed as months); a grace period of 7 years; and an interest rate of 2% (4). On October 8; 2011 Cameroonian president Paul Biya and Chinese Ambassador to Cameroon Xue Jinwei were present at the groundbreaking ceremony for construction on the first phase of the report (5). At the time of writing it was expected that construction would take 36 months and that the port would be delivered in 2014. 

In April 2015 the contractor’s website announced that works on the first phase of the port had finished on April 6th of that year; after a total of 42 months of construction (6). Following a call for tenders; the right to manage the container terminal of the port was awarded to a consortium made up of CHEC and two French companies; Bolloré and CMA CGM; while the right to operate the multipurpose terminal went to the consortium of the French Necotrans and the Cameroonian Kribi Port Multi Operators (KPMO) (7). 

It should also be noted that sources reporting on the financing of the second phase of port construction indicate that the first phase cost US$574M; as opposed to the initial contract amount of US$497M; and that the excess cost was being covered within the phase two loan agreement (8).

(CFHEC)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2012 the Government of Cameroon signed a loan agreement with China Eximbank for a preferential buyer’s credit worth $US482M to fund the first phase of construction on a highway connecting the cities of Yaoundé and Douala. The project was contracted to China First Highway Engineering and initiated construction in 2014; though complications in financing and implementation have caused several delays to the project such that it has yet to reach completion.

In 2012; the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported that on June 28th of that year the Government of Cameroon and China Eximbank signed a loan agreement in Yaoundé to fund construction on an 80 km section of the Cameroon National Highway 3 (N3) connecting Yaoundé and Douala (1).  The project’s total cost is US$568M; with the loan agreement consisting of a preferential buyer’s credit of US$482M.

By February 2014; however; complications had started to arise. According to reporting by Business in Cameroon; the contractor indicated that commencement had been delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of the project (2). The article further reported that Cameroonian authorities had made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes; leading the contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015 construction had commenced; as reported by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before the time of writing (3). The article also reported that construction was slated to take a total of 60 months; with 12 months allotted to engineering design studies and 48 months scheduled for construction. However; in 2017 delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2 and concluding in June after settlements were paid (4). 

As of 2020; the project was expected to reach completion by the end of the year. In February 2020 Business in Cameroon reported that construction was 80% complete; with only 6 of 36 engineering structures yet to be finished (5). In regards to up-to-date details on funding and specifications; the article reports an estimated cost ranging between XAF284 billion and XAF337.84 billion for a 60 km 2-by-2 lane highway; extensible to 3 lanes; reaching from kilometer point 0 to the Bibodi interchange. In an April update; the company in charge of supervising the works; SCET-TUNISIE; reported that the project was still planned to reach completion by December in spite of the impacts of COVID-19 (6).

"CM.018","Implementation",2011,"Cameroon","Government","Eximbank","EBC",542,,"Libor 6 months + 310 bps",5,"15","Memve'ele Hydropower Project 211 MW","Power","Sinohydro Ltd.",,"NARRATIVE: In May 2011; the Government of Cameroon and China Eximbank signed a US$541M loan agreement for the construction of the 211 MW hydroelectric dam in Nyabizan in the Ntem Valley by Chinese contractor Sinohydro. As of July 2020; the project had yet to reach completion; though it was scheduled to be finished by December 2020.

Plans to construct the Memve’ele dam had been in the works long before the 2011 loan signing; with previous efforts including collaboration with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency to conduct feasibility studies and the signing of a Build-Operate-Transfer agreement with a British firm in 2007; the latter of which fell through due to the government’s inability to fulfill conditions of the agreement that called for construction of roads to the project as well as other requirements (1). The 2011 loan from Eximbank came in the form of an export buyer’s credit of US$541M; reported to be 85% of the total project cost of US$637M; with the remaining 15% of costs covered by the Cameroonian government (2)(3).

The project officially broke ground on June 15; 2012; with Cameroonian President Paul Biya and Chinese Ambassador to Cameroon Xue Jinwei in attendance (4).  At the time; the project was slated to take a total of 54 months; indicating a 2017 completion. In 2015; the Cameroonian government Prospectus reported that work on the 211 MW capacity dam was progressing and that the second phase of construction had begun in June 2014 while the finish date was still scheduled for 2017 (5). However; by January 2020 the project was still in implementation; as delays to the construction of a 30km transport line reportedly set back the project timeline; with the current completion date set at December 2020 (6).

Some other aspects of the project to note include the fact that some official sources report that the project has a capacity of 201 MW (7); while others (including the 2015 prospectus) report the 211 MW capacity figure (8). Given that 211 MW is the more oft-cited number by both government and media sources; this is taken to be the correct capacity. Additionally; in January 2017 Cameroonian news agencies reported that the president had recently signed a decree authorizing the signing of a loan agreement worth XAF 83 billion with China Eximbank (9). This figure of XAF 83 billion is reported to be part of the original XAF 243 billion (US$541M) loan agreement.

Ltd.",,"NARRATIVE: In 2016 the Government of Cameroon and China Eximbank signed a concessional loan for CNY937.5M to finance the country’s E-National Higher Education Network project. The project was contracted to Sichuan Telecom Construction Engineering Co Ltd (SCTCC) and divided into two components; which began to be implemented in 2017 and 2018; respectively; and are expected to have reached completion.

In 2012 the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported that the Cameroonian Ministry of Higher Education signed a memorandum of understanding with the Cameroonian subsidiary of the contractor’s parent company China Communications Services Corporation; in which it was determined that the latter party would undertake feasibility studies; environmental assessments and construction for the project (1). In 2015 the Ministry of Commerce reported that the project had been furnished a loan worth approximately XAF 75 billion by Eximbank and that the intergovernmental framework agreement for the project had been signed in Beijing but was still awaiting the Cameroonian president’s authorization of the loan agreement before the project could officially begin (2). The following year on July 27; 2016; the president issued a decree authorizing the Minister of the Economy; Planning; and Regional Development to sign a loan with Eximbank in the amount of CNY937.5M (3). 

In 2018; the Ministry of Education released a technical memo on the project that included a number of details regarding the project’s development; the terms of the Eximbank loan; and the implementation timeline (4). According to this document; the loan agreement with Eximbank was officially signed on August 22; 2016; and the first round of finances (30% of the total) was released on Jun 5; 2017 to project manager SCTCC; who was the exclusive recipient of all Eximbank funds as “no funds are made available to the direct management of the Government of Cameroon by Eximbank China.” The terms of the loan included a 2% interest rate and a repayment term of 20 years with a moratorium of 5 years. 

The project included two components; the first of which was known as “One student – One computer;” and provided for the acquisition; transportation; distribution; and maintenance of 500;000 laptops at a total cost of XAF 50 billion (5). The timeline of this component was set to provide computers to students across the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 academic years. The second component of the project; the development of e-Learning and e-Administration; consisted of the construction; equipment; and operationalization of nine University Digital Development Centers and a National University Data Center at a total cost of XAF 25 billion. The timeline of this component was set to begin in the first quarter of 2018 and to continue for 18 months; which would indicate a completion date midway through 2019.

The following October; the Cameroonian government signed a contract with Poly Technologies Inc.--a subsidiary of China Poly Group Corporation Ltd.--for the supply of two navy patrol vessels; referred to as P108 and P109. 

According to a 2019 report on public debt published by Cameroon’s government; on May 24; 2012 a loan was signed with Eximbank China for the purpose of a “Projet de Livraison du Matériel Militaire au MINDEF;” or “Military Equipment Delivery Project for MINDEF” (1). The document records the loan denomination as Euros; and gives a total loan amount of EUR252;450;000.

Later; media accounts emerged that pointed to the signing of a contract between Cameroon and China in October 2013 for two naval vessels with pennant numbers P108 and P109 (2). As reported by Journal du Cameroun; on April 14; 2014 the Cameroonian Minister of Defense received the two ships in Qingdao after a construction period of 18 months by the company “Polytechnologies” (presumed to be Poly Technologies Inc.) (3). According to the article; the construction was made possible by funding from China Eximbank through a loan signed between the Ministry of Defense and Poly Technologies Inc. in October 2013. In January 2015 a report citing imagery from an Airbus Defense and Space satellite indicated that as of January 23; 2015 the two vessels were moored in Douala (4). 

The links between the 2012 loan reported by the 2019 public debt report and the contract for the vessels P108 and P109 are speculative. Considerations of their being connected stem from the overlapping timeline of loan signings; the absence of a loan directly referencing a contract for naval vessels in the 2019 debt report; and the recurrence of Eximbank as financier. Thus; the thinking goes that a loan for military equipment construction and delivery was first signed in 2012 and that the October 2013 loan for P108 and P109 fell within the framework of the original signing; either specifying its usage or forming some part of the loan total.

Phase I; which was contracted to CGCOC Group; addressed the provision of potable water to the four cities of Bafoussam; Bamenda; Kribi; and Sangmelima.

In September 2013; the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported that on August 29th of that year President Paul Biya issued a decree authorizing the signing of a framework agreement for the loan (1). On October 11; 2013 the president issued a decree that authorized the Minister of the Economy; Planning; and Regional Development to sign a loan valued at CNY1.059 billion (approximately XAF84.72 billion) for the first phase of the project (2).

In a November 2013 report from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce; it was reported that the first phase of the project was expected to enter implementation the following year (3). In 2017 the website of the Chinese Embassy in Cameroon reported on the signing of the second phase of the project and remarked that the first phase had been funded through a concessional loan (优惠贷款) and constructed by the CGCOC Group (4).

While it appears clear that the first phase of the project has been completed; the precise year of its completion is somewhat unclear. Whereas the aforementioned report by the Chinese Embassy indicates that the project was completed in 2017; a 2020 report from the Cameroon Tribune writes that the project was “accepted” in 2019 (5).

There is very little further information on the project; which has presumably been completed given that the country signed a loan for a second phase of the National Broadband Network Project in 2015. Seeing as the contractor for the project’s second phase was Huawei Technologies Co.; Ltd.; who has been contracted on numerous other communications projects in the country; it seems likely that Huawei contributed to the completion of this project as well; though this cannot be said for certain.

The project was contracted to Huawei and had reached 90% completion by 2019. 

On October 30; 2015 the Government of Cameroon released a presidential decree authorizing the Ministry of the Economy; Planning; and Regional Development to sign a preferential loan agreement with China Eximbank in the amount of US$337;121;984 (approximately XAF198.9 billion) to finance the construction of phase two of the National Broadband Network (1). In November 2015; the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reposted an article from Invest in Cameroon that reported on the signing of the loan agreement and gave more details of the project; noting that it would be implemented by local company CAMTEL and Chinese contractor Huawei and that it would cover 13 cities and add an additional 3;000 km to the existing fiber optic network (2).

In a November 2017 article from the website of Cameroon’s Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications discussing the major projects taking place in the information technologies sector; the project was said to have been in its completion phase (3). However; the ministry’s Medium-Term Expenditure Framework for 2020-2022 reported that at the time of publishing in 2019 the project was 90.27% complete (4). Additionally; the document lists projected expenses for the project through 2020; indicating that at the earliest it would be completed at some point this year.

It should be noted that this project is separate from the National Fiber-Optic Backbone Expansion (CM.020); which is also financed by a loan from China Eximbank and contracted to Huawei. This is confirmed by the two projects being independently identified by both Chinese (5) and Cameroonian (6) sources.

The loan package consists of a US$150M concessional loan and US$524.5M in preferential export buyer’s credit. Construction work on the project was contracted to China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) and the project was in implementation as of August 2020.

In February 2016; an article from the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cameroon described reports from the Cameroon Tribune that detailed the Government of Cameroon’s application for a loan package from China Eximbank that included a US$150M concessional loan and US$524.5M in preferential export buyer’s credit; with the terms of the loan package being a 20 year maturity and 2% annual interest rate (1). According to the Tribune article; China Eximbank indicated its willingness to offer such a loan.

The following year; on April 7; 2017; the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported that a loan signing ceremony had been held on April 5; with several Chinese and Cameroonian government officials in attendance (2). On April 8; CHEC also reported on the loan signing; noting that the loans would fund 85% of the US$794M project; while 15% would be raised by the project owner (ostensibly referring to the Government of Cameroon) (3). The CHEC article wrote that the project includes a 70;000 ton container terminal as well as a 100;000 ton container terminal.

Two years later; in an article published September 2019; China Daily reported that at the time Chinese companies were “actively planning to implement the second phase of the Kribi Deepwater Port project;” implying that construction had yet to begin (4). The following month; media outlets Business in Cameroon and Financial Afrik reported that officials from the project team confirmed that China Eximbank was financing 85% of the XAF456.7 billion project (which gives the US$674.5M figure reported earlier) while also implying that the finances had yet to be released; writing; “To date; the funding agreements’ elaboration procedure is being finalized” (5)(6).

In July 2020 Chinese media outlet Sina Finance reposted an article reporting that steel from Benxi Steel Group was to be used in the construction of the second phase of the Kribi port (7). The following month; another article from Sina Finance reported that steel from Benxi Steel Group had been used in the construction on the port (8). This implies that as recently as August 2020 the project was in implementation.

"CM.049","Implementation",2016,"Cameroon","Government","ICBC","CommL",303,,,,,"Warak Hydropower Project on Bini River; Adamaoua 75MW","Power","Sinohydro Ltd.",,"NARRATIVE: In July 2016; the government of Cameroon signed a commercial loan agreement with ICBC for the construction of a 75 MW hydropower plant in Warak; on the Bini river (1). The loan is denominated in USD and valued at $302;944;728; which represents 85% of the total project cost; the other 15% is to be paid by the Cameroon government. Construction of the plant; which is contracted to Sinohydro; began sometime in 2016 and is scheduled for completion in December 2021 (2).

A feasibility study for the project; funded by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA); was conducted as early as 2008 (3). The Warak hydropower project then became part of Cameroon’s Electricity Sector Development Plan; along with several other hydroelectric plants (4). As of 2015; it was intended to be financed by TDA (5). In 2016; however; the project found financing through ICBC instead. The loan was signed on July 28; 2016 by ICBC Director General Mrs. Mina Shen and Cameroon Minister of Economy; Planning and Regional Development Louis Paul Motaze (6). Construction plans include a hydroelectric dam; 70 kilometers of 225 Kv energy transmission lines; 30 Kv rural electricity lines; and the rehabilitation and construction of site access routes (7).

Since then; construction of the Warak hydropower project has experienced a number of delays. In late 2017; it was reported that there had been “difficulties” in securing the release of committed funds from ICBC; meaning that the Cameroon government was unable to pay contractors working on site (8). The project was confirmed to be on hiatus from February to November 2019 due to the Cameroon government’s failure to pay “insurance charges” to ICBC; which further delayed the disbursement of loan funds (9). Then; in July 2020; construction was suspended once again; with Cameroon government officials claiming that ICBC still refused to release the remaining funds for the project in spite of the fact that Cameroon had “acquitted itself of all conditions” for disbursement (10). Despite these setbacks; the directors of the Warak construction site have expressed optimism that funding will resume soon after negotiations with ICBC.

The project is contracted to the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) and had reached 88.14% completion as of January 2020. It is slated for completion by fall 2021.

On May 16; 2014; the government of Cameroon; represented by the Ministry of Economy; Planning; and Regional Development (MINEPAT); signed an agreement with China Eximbank for a preferential buyer’s credit worth US$385;808;808.60 (1). This loan represents approximately 85% of the total US$453;892;716 contract amount; with the remainder intended to be financed by the government of Cameroon. The loan carries a 2% interest rate; 5-year grace period; and 15-year repayment period; giving it a total maturity of 20 years (1).

Construction of the Kribi-Lolabe highway was put on hiatus for the last few months of 2019 before resuming in January 2020 (2). CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated at this point that the highway stood at 88.14% completion and would be operational by the “second semester” of 2020. However; in December 2020; Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the government’s 15% of the project cost; admitting that Cameroon could not honor its share of the cost due to “a series of crises” (3). The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021 (4).

This second phase comprises works to serve 184 communities and was contracted to Huawei Technologies Co.; Ltd.

As the second phase of a larger project; works to implement the photovoltaic system that will service 184 communities in Cameroon have been in talks for some time. According to pv magazine; a monthly trade publication covering the photovoltaic industry; the first agreement for the project was signed in September 2012 (1). 

Years later; on June 9;2017; the Government of Cameroon formally signed a loan with the Bank of China in the amount of US$123;250;000 for the second phase of the “Projet d'électrification de 350 localités par système solaire photovoltaique [sic]” (2). According to IMF Country Report No. 18/9; released in January 2018 using data collected in 2017; the loan is non-concessional and comes with a 2 year grace period and a maturity of 10 years (3). 

As reported by local media agency Business in Cameroon on December 14; 2018; the Cameroonian Ministry of Water and Energy (Minee) noted that it had spent the year working toward the completion of the first phase of the project and launching the second phase (4). In September 2020 Energies-media reported on a change in management for the works completed in the first phase of the project and noted that the second phase is being carried out by Huawei; implying that construction was still ongoing at the time (5).

Contractor Sinohydro completed the Grand Poubara dam in 2013 (2).
 
The signing ceremony for the US$318 million concessional loan; which took place on May 24; 2008; was attended by Omar Bongo; President of Gabon; Jean Eyeghe Ndong; Prime Minister of Gabon; and Xin Jinwei; the Chinese Ambassador to Gabon (1). The loan was intended to fund 75% of the Phase I construction costs of the Grand Poubara dam; with the additional 25% provided by the Government of Gabon (3). Contracted to Sinohydro; Phase I of the Poubara dam included four turbines capable of producing 160 MW (2).
 
The Poubara dam was a component of the US$3 billion Belinga Iron ore project. The same day the aforementioned loan agreement was signed; COMIBEL; which is 75% owned by China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC); signed a Mining Rights Agreement for the Belinga iron ore deposit with the Government of Gabon (1). Located in a remote inland region of Gabon; Belinga is one of the world’s largest untapped reserves of iron ore and development of the site necessitated the construction of additional infrastructure (4). Poubara was supposed to contribute the energy supply that would support mining operations at Belinga. However; Comibel lost its mining concession for Belinga; though it was reimbursed for the costs it had incurred in 2013 (4).
 
Construction of the Poubara dam began in 2008; with a groundbreaking ceremony attended by President Bongo; Prime Minister Ndong; Chinese Ambassador Xin Jinwei; and Hung Kun of Sinohydro (6). Construction was completed in 2013 (2).

Construction began two months prior to parliamentary approval of the loan (3).
 
The Farasol-Mbega road was part of Gabon’s National Infrastructure Masterplan (SDNI); a project that aimed to boost economic growth through the construction of modern infrastructure (2). The road was to connect Gabon’s second largest city; Port Gentil; with a sports stadium and venue of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations soccer tournament (1)(4). More importantly; the road was to connect Port Gentil with the larger national network of roads south of the city. A press release from Gabon’s General Directorate of Debt described Port Gentil as the “largest important economic zone in the country” and stressed the benefits that would come from facilitating the exchange of goods and services between this region and the rest of the country (4).
 
Construction of the Farasol-Mbega road began with a groundbreaking ceremony on February 29; 2016 with President of Gabon Ali Bongo in attendance (3). In 2016; Gabon’s General Directorate of Debt and Gabon’s National Assembly both specified that construction time was to be 36 months(1)(4).

The project was contracted to China Road and Bridge Corporation and was completed in 2019.

In March 2013; the Chinese Ministry of Commerce reported that the Gabonese president signed two financing agreements with China Eximbank to finance the construction of a 93km highway; which includes the building of a bridge; from Port-Gentil to Ombué; a project which would cost approximately US$660M and take 60 months to complete (1). Later that year; on September 30; the Ministry of Commerce reported that Chinese Ambassador to Gabon Sun Jiwen and Gabonese Minister of the Economy Luc Oyoubi signed a preferential loan framework agreement for a loan from the Chinese government of no more than CNY810M for the road and bridge construction (2).

The following year; in a speech by Ambassador Sun at the opening project’s opening ceremony on July 3; the Ambassador named China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) as the contractor and claimed that it was being financed by the Chinese government through a China Eximbank preferential loan of US$630M (3). Later that month; an article in the China Daily reported that the general manager of CRBC operations in Gabon claimed the project cost was US$600M and that China was funding 95% of this amount through low-interest loans from China Eximbank; though the US$600 figure may be a ballpark number as 95% of the originally reported total cost of US$660M gives the US$630M amount reported in the Ambassador’s speech (4). The article also revealed that the project would require two bridges and that a second 270 km phase was being planned. 

A website documenting Chinese overseas engineering project campsites reported on the construction of the Port-Gentil to Omboué road gave several details about the project’s implementation; including a precise project cost of US$663;761;561.7 (95% of which is US$630;573;484); a construction period of 60 months; and the note that the project followed an EPC model funded through a combination of preferential buyer’s credits and commercial loans from China Eximbank; as well as contributions from the Gabonese government (5). Knowing that the Ministry of Commerce reported that no more than CNY810M (approximately US$134M) would be provided through a preferential loan; the remainder (US$493M) is presumed to be commercial loan. The article also indicates that construction on the project finished on March 19; 2019.

Construction began in 2017 (3) and the first school at Nkok; near the city of Ntoum; was completed in 2021 (4).
 
On June 15; 2013; Gabon’s Minister of Vocational Training signed the commercial contract with Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) for the construction of the three vocational training centers near Franceville (Mvengue; 20 hectares); Port Gentil (Ntchengue; 20 hectares); and Ntoum (Nkok; 10 hectares) (5). On November 11; 2015; Regis Immongault; Gabon’s Minister of Sustainable Development; Economy; Investment Promotion and Foresight; signed the US$101 million loan agreement with China Eximbank in Beijing (2). The loan has an interest rate of 2% and a term of 20 years that includes a grace period of 5 years and a repayment period of 15 years (2). The loan was to provide 85% of the necessary funding for the construction of the three centers; with the additional 15% of funding to be covered by the Government of Gabon (3).
 
Conceived under the Gabon Emergent Strategies Plan (PSGE); the vocational training center project was projected to increase access to professional training and reduce youth unemployment; which press reports indicated stood at 35% at the time the plans for the centers were being drawn up (2)(6). Once completed; each vocational training center will accommodate approximately 1000 trainees and be equipped with workshops; sports areas; laboratories; administrative offices; dining rooms; dormitories; amphitheaters; and accommodations for supervisory staff (3). Trainees will be given the opportunity to partake in different levels of professional training and receive certification (3). Speaking about the centers; the President of Gabon; Ali Bongo; observed that businesses currently lacked an incentive to invest in Gabon because Gabon could not offer a qualified workforce. He also acknowledged criticism of Gabon’s professional training system; which had been accused of ignoring the needs of businesses (3). The concept for the three new vocational schools placed an emphasis on cooperation with the private sector. The center at Nkok; for example; is located in a special economic zone that hosts around 10 Chinese businesses among others (7).
 
Construction of the centers began in August 2017; with a ceremony attended by the President of Gabon; Ali Bongo; Gabon’s Minister of Labor; Eloi Nzondo; and the President of AVIC; Liu Jun (3). Disbursement of the loan commenced in 2018; and The School at Nkok was opened by Ali Bongo on April 9; 2021 (4) (8). Construction at the Mvengue and Ntchengue sites is still ongoing as of June 2021.

The loans under this facility carry a 5.5% interest rate; 2-year grace period; and 3-year repayment period (2). As security for the debt contracted under the 2006 credit line; Equatorial Guinea is required to deposit proceeds from its hydrocarbon exports to China in Eximbank accounts (3). By 2018; approximately US$1.2B in loan commitments had been signed out of the credit line.

On July 16; 2017; CSCEC broke ground on the Oyala New Capital project (1). Eximbank issued loans for the three components of the project in November 2017 (4); with the loan for 10 ministerial buildings valued at US$208;423;208.75 (5). As of May 2020; CSCEC had not yet completed construction (6).

SRN is a joint venture that is 60% owned by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and 40% owned by the Government of Chad (2). The loan was used to finance the Government of Chad’s 40% stake in the Djarmaya refinery (2). The project began implementation in 2008 and was completed in 2011 (3)(4).
 
CNPC began its involvement in Chad in 2003; and purchased the Block H oil exploration area in 2006 (3). Construction of the Djarmaya refinery was part of the first phase of CNPC’s upstream and downstream integrated project; which also included construction of the Ronier oilfield and a 311 km pipeline between the refinery and the oilfield (3). For the Government of Chad; the oil refinery component of CNPC’s upstream-downstream project represented the possibility of reducing Chad’s reliance on refined product imports (2).
 
On September 20; 2007; CNPC and the Chad’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy signed an agreement under which they assented to jointly construct the Djarmaya oil refinery (3). On August 2; 2009; CNPC President; Jiang Jiemin; and Chad’s Oil and Mineral Resources Minister; Mahamat Hassan Nasser; signed the memorandum of understanding for the preferential export buyer’s credit. The same day; representatives of CNPC and Chad’s Government also signed the joint venture agreement (5). The preferential export buyer’s credit agreement was signed in 2011 (2). The loan has a 15-year term; a 5-year grace period and was secured with a government guarantee issued by the Government of Chad as well as stakes in the refinery (1). The government guarantee was issued first; but Sinosure refused to insure the loan; which it deemed too risky. Subsequently; CNPC arranged for Chad’s shares to be used as collateral and offered its own shares in the project as collateral for its own portion of the loan (1).
 
The groundbreaking ceremony for the Djarmaya refinery was held on October 26; 2008; approximately three years before the loan agreement for the project was signed (3). On July 10; 2011; the refinery produced its first batch of diesel fuel (3). In January 2012; the Government of Chad suspended the oil refinery deal with CNPC and announced that it would expel the Chinese director of the plant and renegotiate the deal. Disagreements over fuel prices had caused the relationship between the joint venture partners to deteriorate (5). In August 2013; the Government of Chad suspended CNPC’s operations in Chad; accusing CNPC of violating environmental standards at the company’s Ronier oilfield (4)(6). Work resumed shortly thereafter but was halted again in May 2014; after CNPC refused to pay a US1.2B fine. Preparing to take the dispute to international arbitration; the Government of Chad; in October 2014; threatened to revoke and re-auction CNPC’s oil exploration licenses. The dispute was settled the same month; when CNPC agreed to pay a US$400M fine and concede to the Government of Chad a 10% stake in existing oil operations in the country; as well as a 25% stake in future oil operations (5). In exchange; the arbitration case was dropped and CNPC was permitted to export oil through the Chad-Cameroon pipeline. It has been suggested that Chad was emboldened to take such a tough stance against the Chinese company because; at the time; other foreign investors were showing significant interest in Chad’s oil sector and taking steps to expand their operations in the country (5). Despite the turbulent history of the Djarmaya refinery; it appears that CNPC and the Government of Chad have maintained a 60/40 partnership in the project (7).

The 66 kv transmission line that connects the Djarmaya refinery with Chad’s capital city; N’Djamena; was completed in 2013 and the 90 kv ring network transmission line for N’Djamena was completed in 2015 (4)(5).
 
The two power projects were conceived at a time when only 3-4% of Chad’s 11M inhabitants had access to electricity. Muhamat Senoussi Cherif; the director of Chad’s state-owned energy company; Societe Nationale d’Electricite (SNE); estimated that N’Djamena’s energy demand alone stood at 93.37 MW; with only 25.2 MW supplied in 2010 and 53MW available in all of Chad (6). The power projects called for the construction of a transmission system that would connect the capital city with the 60MW Farcha power plant and the Djarmaya refinery; which produces 40MW (3).
 
In April 2010; the Government of Chad and CMEC signed the two commercial contracts for construction of the two power projects (4). The contracts had a combined value of US$185M and the Eximbank loan that was secured two years after the commercial contracts were signed; financed 70% of these contracts; with the additional 30% provided by the Government of Chad (3). The loan was disbursed in tranches (7).
 
Construction of the 40 km transmission line connecting the Djarmaya refinery with the Lamadji transformer station in N’Djamena took 24 months and was completed in March 2013 (4). Chad’s President; Idriss Deby; and the Minister of Infrastructure and Public Equipment; Gata Ngoulou; attended the ceremony. The second project included a 60 km loop of underground and overhead transmission lines in the vicinity of N’Djamena as well as 10000 household connections. This project was completed and energized on January 29; 2015 (5).

The loan financed the modernization of Chad’s national information and communications technologies (NTIC). The project was contracted to Huawei Technologies CO.; LTD and began implementation in 2020 (3).
 
The NTIC project was one of five priority projects that the President of Chad; Idriss Deby; presented to Xi Jinping at the 2018 FOCAC summit in Beijing (3). On June 26; 2019; the Chinese Ambassador to Chad; Li Jinjin; and Chad’s Minister of Economy and Development Planning; Issa Dubrani; signed a framework agreement for the loan in Chad’s capital city; N’Djamena (4). Chad’s parliament unanimously approved the loan on April 30; 2020 approximately 10 months after the framework agreement was signed. The loan has an interest rate of 2%; a grace period of 5 years; and a total term of 20 years (2).
 
The project itself includes three components: the construction of a national data center; the construction of a 1200 km optic fiber cable network spanning the country from south to east; and a 50 km loop of fiber optic cables in the vicinity of N’Djamena with 200 2G/3G/4G sites (3).

Under the agreement; DAC would lend the full loan amount received from CMP to Port de Djibouti SA (PDSA). PDSA would then use the loan to develop; upgrade and operate its facilities and assets. PDSA is a private subsidiary of Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA); the government authority that administers and controls all of Djibouti’s free zones and ports. CMP holds 23.5% of shares in PDSA; and DPFZA owns 76.5% of shares in PDSA. The US$150M multiplied by DPFZA’s 76.5% ownership is US$115M; which is the amount of actual debt the Djibouti government accrued from this loan agreement. The project was completed in 2018. 

In 2015; CMP signed a framework agreement with DPFZA for the extension of the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ). On January 15; 2017; China Merchant Holdings Vice President; Hu Jianhua; signed a US$150M supplier’s credit facility agreement with the DAC. The DAC is Khor Ambado Free Zone Company FZCO; a free zone limited liability company tasked with investing in and financing the development rights for commercial and infrastructure projects within the DIFTZ. CMP granted DAC the loan on August 17; 2017 and expected DAC to lend the total amount to PDSA. The CMP loan given to DAC had an initial term of one year; with a potential 10-year extension. Interest would be determined by the highest amount of two options: a 5% per annum interest rate on the outstanding loan amount or 50% of the interest payable by PDSA to DAC for the relevant year. DPFZA provided a share pledge of 15.3% in Great Horn Investment Holdings SAS (GHIH); another DPFZA subsidiary; as the security on the loan (1).

On the same day; DAC granted the US$150M loan to PDSA for the development; upgrade and operation of PDSA facilities and assets. The DAC loan has an initial term of one year; with a potential 10-year extension. The interest would be determined by the highest amount of two options: a 5% per annum interest rate on the outstanding loan amount or the amount equal to 20% x 90% x PDSA’s net profit of the previous financial year. DPFZA security guarantee also applies to this loan(2).

In July 2018; Djibouti launched the DIFTZ with upgraded and expanded port facilities (3). In September 2018; the government of Djibouti nationalized the Dolareh Container Terminal (DCT); an asset held by PDSA. The change in DCT ownership affected PDSA’s expected profits; because PDSA’s profits included dividend receivables from DCT. As a result; the potential chargeable interest on the CMP/DAC loan facility; which would be determined in part by PDSA profits; was rendered invalid. The DCT nationalization also affected DPFZA’s share pledge value. On November 9; 2018; CMP and DAC signed an agreement to extend the loan facility for another 6 months in order to amend the terms of the CMP loan (4).

China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) completed the project in 2016. 

 In 2011; the Addis-Ababa Railway project began in Ethiopia. The old 780km line was the only railway line connecting landlocked Ethiopia with a Djibouti Port. After years of deterioration due to mismanagement; a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (1). The Djibouti portion required US$550M for renovations (2). 

In 2013; the Government of Djibouti and China Eximbank signed a loan agreement worth US$491.8M for financing the construction of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway 98km Ali Sabieh to Nagad section (3). The loan has a 6M Libor+3% interest rate; a 6 year grace period and a 15 year term (4). While the loan provided 85% of the project’s financing; the government provided 15% by paying 5% of the cost and selling 10% of the railway’s shares to CCECC (6). Sinosure provided insurance on the loan and the government also issued a sovereign guarantee (5). CCECC won the EPC contract to execute the project in 2011. 

At the Council of Ministers 10th meeting; a draft law of the loan agreement was presented and ratified. Through the project’s completion; the government planned to advance railway development; increase regional integration; reduce travel time; provide job creation and increase revenue generation. They also expected the project to designate Djibouti as the main port for South Sudan imports and Ethiopian oil exports (6). 

On December 31st; 2014; CCECC laid the first track down in Galile; a small town along the railway line. President Ismail Omar Guelleh; several Djibouti ministers; Chinese Ambassador to Djibouti; Mr. Fu Huaqiang; and Assistant president and manager of CCECC’s African Department; Mr. Li Wuliang attended the inauguration ceremony (7). In 2015; problems surrounding the project’s execution arose. President Guelleh pushed for the project to be completed before the 2016 election. Cutting the completion time from 5 years to 2.5 years pressured CCECC to accelerate their work. To adjust for the time limit; CCECC allegedly used its own financing for the project’s initial stages until they received China Eximbank’s disbursements. CCECC also stopped work on the project for at least 2 weeks in January. Djibouti authorities blamed CCECC manager Ding Zhaojun for the delay; claiming that he hadn’t settled all the required purchases on the Nagad to Doraleh portion. Djibouti authorities also complained about CCECC’s poor mismanagement; leading to $24 million in cost overruns because CCECC had not taken electrifying the railway into account. The government also claimed CCECC used poor quality infrastructure materials and failed to comply with railway regulations. China International Engineering Consulting Corporation was later on called in to examine the quality of CCECC’s work. Despite setbacks; CCECC completed the railway in compliance with Chinese electrified railway standards in 2016 (8).

On July 28; 2016; after completion; CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management agreement with a consortium of other Chinese companies. This consortium will manage the railway for 5 years and provide training to Djibouti workers who will assume management after the 5-year term ends (9).

While China Merchant Group facilitated the Chinese finance; the projects were contracted to China State Construction Corporation (CSCC) and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC).

On August 17; 2014; CSCC signed a US$420M EPC contract for the expansion of the Multipurpose Port of Dolareh. Port de Djibouti SA (PDSA); jointly held by China Merchant Group and Djibouti Ports and Free Zone Authority; owns the project (1). CSCC planned to expand the port by adding six new berths with the capacity to accomodate ships carrying up to 100;000 tonnes of cargo (2). The added berths would increase the port’s holding capacity to 8.2 million tons a year (3). CSCC would also construct the structure of the wharf; the east-west revetment of the port area; the formation and foundation of the land area; the road yard; and housing. 

Under a US$70M contract; CSECC would construct terminal D of the Arta region Damerjog Livestock Port; where livestock is stored and transported. CSECC planned to construct a 655 meter long quay for up to five ships and a holding area for 150;000 heads of livestock to increase total holding capacity to 10 million heads of livestock per year. Djibouti authorities expected the port to increase annual exports to US$500M (4).

On April 15; 2016; the Government of Djibouti and China Eximbank signed a US$344M concessional loan agreement for the construction and expansion of both ports. The loan has a 7 year grace period and a 20 year term. The annual interest rate is fixed and is up to 2% with a management fee of 0.5% and a commitment fee of 0.25% per annum (5).

The loan was divided into three disbursements; with US$220M as the first portion. China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) jointly completed the project through a consortium in 2016. 

The 780km line is the only railway line connecting landlocked Ethiopia with a Djibouti Port. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia invited a technical delegation from CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to lack of finance funds (1). After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement; a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated. The total project cost for the Ethiopian portion was about US$3.4B (2). 

The Government of Ethiopia awarded CREC and CCECC the project. In October 2011; CREC received the US$1.53B EPC contract to build the 328.959km section from Sebeta to Miesso. China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group was contracted to design CREC’s portion. CCECC was contracted to complete the 339km section; which was from Miesso to Ethiopia’s border with Djibouti (3). China Eximbank provided approximately US$2.5B for construction; 70% of the projects cost; while the Government of Ethiopia provided 30%(4). The loan had a 6MLibor+3% interest rate; 6 year grace period and a 15 year term (5). About US$220M was disbursed first; and CREC began construction in 2012 (6). 

The project consisted of a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama and a single track from Adama to Dewele. Other key aspects of the project included a 1035 meter long bridge; the longest bridge in Ethiopia; the grand bridge at DK42; the 155 meter Awash grand bridge and a Labu station upgrade (7). By 2014; the project was 50% complete (7). CREC and CCECC completed the project in 2016; but the railway became fully operational in 2018. On July 28; 2016; after completion; the consortium of Chinese companies signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management agreement. This consortium will manage the railway for 5 years and provide training to Djibouti workers who will assume management after the 5-year term ends (8).

During the opening ceremony in 2018; Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia; Tan Jian noted the project was a part of the Belt and Road Initiative. The project is also considered a fulfillment of  railway plans under Ethiopia’s Growth Plan 2(6).

ZTE obtained 6 telecom circles to complete the expansion project from this deal; but in 2014; Ethio Telecom gave four of those circles to Ericsson; a swedish telecommunications company. ZTE completed TEP in 2 telecom circles under a new supplier’s credit contract worth US$300M in 2018. 

In 2013; the Government of Ethiopia signed a US$1.6B multi-vendor market sharing deal with ZTE and Huawei for the Ethio Telecom TEP. Under the deal; Ethio Telecom awarded Huawei with 7 telecom circles and ZTE with 6 telecom circles. ZTE initially provided US$800M for their portion of the project (1). The loan had a 6M Libor+1.5% interest rate; a 3 year grace period and a 13 year term (2). ZTE was responsible for expanding 3G network access. Their efforts; along with the other contractors; were intended to increase mobile coverage to 80% of Ethiopians which also meant an increase of subscribers from 25 million to 60 million. 

In 2014; ZTE and Ethio Telecom began to have conflict. ZTE determined their portion of the project would cost US$150M-US$200M; more than the amount Ethio Telecom originally planned (3). ZTE also refused to work on swapping out the old telecom networks. In response to ZTE; Ethio Telecom terminated the US$800M framework agreement with ZTE in April 2014. Later that year; Ericsson was awarded a US$500M contract to complete TEP in the 4 circles that were previously given to ZTE (4). Ethio Telecom allowed ZTE to complete TEP in the east and middle east circles under a US$300M contract. 

Ericsson first intended to complete the project in 2016; but due to disagreements with Ethio telecom management; it suspended their projects. Ethio Telecom responded by taking one of Ericsson’s circles and handing it over to Huawei (5)(6). After a series of negotiations; Ericsson completed its portion of the deal in 2019 (7)(8). ZTE completed its portions of TEP in 2018 (9). This project was a part of Ethiopia’s Growth and Transformation Plan II.

The US$2B loan agreement was one of two loan agreements signed with China Eximbank that day; the other being for a US$1.6 semi-concessional loan (1) (KE.041). The two loans were used to construct 473 km of railway tracks between Mombasa and Nairobi and procure trains from China (2). Contractor China Road and Bridge Corporation began construction in 2013 and Phase I was completed in 2017 (3)(4).
 
The Standard Gauge Railway project is a regional effort to connect Kenya; Uganda; Rwanda and South Sudan by rail (5). In 2013; the four countries signed an agreement to undertake the project (6). Each country is responsible for constructing the portion of the project that runs through its territory; but Kenya is the only country to have begun implementation of its share of the project. Plans for the railway network have been altered and restored to their original state as the four countries have threatened to withdraw from the project or refused to connect their tracks to those of their neighbors (7). At present; however; it appears that all three of Kenya’s partners plan to implement the project (8)(9). The return on Kenya’s investment into the network will depend on its partner countries’ contributions to the project (6).
 
Kenya’s contribution to the SGR project was divided into two phases with a combined cost of US$13B (1). Phase I included two components. First; the construction of 473 km of railway tracks between Mombasa and Nairobi with three major stations at Mombasa; Voi; and Nairobi; as well as 23 crossing stations (5). Second; the procurement of 56 diesel locomotives; 16240 wagons; and 40 coaches from China (3). Phase II included three components. Phase 2a was for the construction of 120 km of railway tracks between Naivasha. Phase 2b called for the construction of a railway line between Naivasha and Kisumu and the development of a high-capacity port at Kisumu. Phase 2c was for the construction of a railway line between Kisumu and Malaba (10). So far; Phases I and 2a have been completed (4)(11).
 
Although the SGR project was first conceived by the government of the former President of Kenya; Mwai Kibaki; it was Kibaki’s successor; President Uhuru Kenyatta; who pushed the idea ahead despite much resistance and invested considerable political capital into the project (6). Proponents of the project point to the SGR’s potential to decrease transportation costs for freight by 60% and the reduction of travel time between Mombasa and Nairobi from 30 to 8 hours (12). The Kenyan opposition and some economists have criticized the increase in Kenya’s external debt that has come with the Eximbank loans that funded the project (13). In the coastal regions of Kenya; many have lamented the negative impact of a decision to ship all containerized cargo by rail; arguing that the decision forced logistics businesses to move their operations away from the coast to inland container depots (14). A 2013 cost benefit analysis conducted by the World Bank; concluded that the SGR project was not economically viable (15).
 
In 2014; Kenya’s President Kenyatta visited China and signed the Memorandum of Understanding for financing of the SGR (6). The signing ceremony for the loan agreement on May 11; 2014; was attended by President Kenyatta; the Chinese Prime Minister; Li Kequiang; the President of Uganda; Yoweri Museveni; the President of Rwanda; Paul Kagame; and the President of South Sudan; Salva Kiir (2). The US$2B commercial loan has an interest rate of LIBOR + 360bps; a term of 15 years; and a grace period of 5 years (12). Eximbank took a number of steps to secure its investment. The Government of Kenya was required to guarantee the loan and confirm that it had the necessary funds to cover its contribution to the project’s costs; including the funds for land acquisition and relocation (12). In addition; Sinosure insured the loan in exchange for the payment of 6.93% of the project’s costs; paid in annual installments. In order to cover the costs of land acquisition and interest rate payments during the grace period; the Government of Kenya began levying a new tax of 1.5% on imported goods that flowed into a Railway Development Fund (RDF) (6)(12). At least part of repayment for the loan is being made from the operating revenue of the railway line; which is deposited into an escrow account that was set up jointly by the Government of Kenya and Eximbank (12). Originally; the operator of the line was to be chosen by public tender; but this arrangement must have been altered when China Communications Construction Company (CCCC); CRBC’s parent company; was awarded the operating contract for the SGR (6). There was no competitive bidding on the contract. Public tendering had already been foregone in the case of the construction contract because Eximbank had made the provision of its loan conditional on the requirement that the project be contracted to a Chinese company (6)(12). In order to circumvent Kenya’s procurement laws; Kenya’s executive insisted that the construction contract for the SGR was a “government-to-government” procurement which does not require competitive bidding under Kenyan law (1).
 
The SGR has been at the center of numerous lawsuits and legal disputes that have threatened the existence of the project itself and led to the arrest of senior Kenyan officials. The first of these disputes concerns CRBC’s construction contract. In 2014; only a few months after construction of Phase I began; an activist; Okiya Omtatah; and the Law Society of Kenya attempted to have the construction contract rescinded on the grounds that procurement laws had been violated (4). Simultaneously; two parliamentary committees investigated the procurement process and Kenya’s Attorney General issued an opinion in which he disagreed with the interpretation of “government-to-government” procurement in the case of the construction contract (1). The lawsuit was dismissed by Kenya’s High Court in 2014 and the parliamentary committees accepted the “government-to-government” interpretation of the procurement process and cleared the project individually in February and April 2014; only weeks before the loan signing on May 11 (1)(4). Construction resumed in December 2014. In June 2020; approximately 3 years after Phase I was completed; Kenya’s Court of Appeals ruled that CRBC’s construction contract was illegal because there had been no public tendering for the contract (4). Although it is unclear how this ruling will affect the SGR project; one of the activists at the Law Society of Kenya suggested that the ruling by the appeals court may be a preparatory step for the Government of Kenya to “plead illegality at an international arbitration should China Road and Bridge Corporation sue for breach of contract.” (4)
 
The second legal dispute pertained to Phase 2a of the SGR. In September 2016; Kenya’s National Environment Tribunal issued a stop order on construction for Phase II after it was revealed that plans for Phase 2a; which traverses Nairobi National Park; had been finalized without conducting the compulsory Environmental Impact Assessment (16). The stop order was upheld by Kenya’s High Court on October 4; 2016; but construction of Phase II began on October 20; 2016; in spite of the court order. In April 2017; activist Okiya Omtatah and the Kenya Coalition for Wildlife obtained another court order and construction was halted (16). In August 2017; Kenya’s Transport Secretary; James Macharia; reported that construction would resume in 14 days; following a ruling by Kenya’s National Environmental Tribunal; which the Secretary anticipated would be favorable (17). Construction of Phase 2a was completed in October 2019 and the Tribunal’s verdict in favor of the Government of Kenya was upheld by the Lands and Environment Court in July 2021 (18).
 
The third legal controversy in connection with the SGR concerns allegations of corruption. In 2018; the Kenyan prosecutor’s office named 18 officials; businesspeople; and companies that had allegedly been involved in a scheme that involved the issuance of false compensation claims for land used by the SGR. These claims were used to divert funds that should have been utilized for the railway. Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri; the chairman of the National Land Commission; and Atanas Karikuri Maina; the managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation; were among those arrested. No Chinese individuals were arrested or named by the prosecutor (13).
 
In September 2020; a report issued by the transport committee of Kenya’s parliament urged the government to renegotiate the terms of the SGR loans as well as CCCC’s contract for operation of the line (19).

The US$1.48B loan agreement for Phase 2a of the SGR was signed in December 2015; on the sidelines of the FOCAC summit (1). The loan has an interest rate of LIBOR + 3% and a term of 15 years (2). In order to cover the costs of land acquisition; the Government of Kenya began levying a new tax of 1.5% on imported goods that flowed into a Railway Development Fund (RDF) (6). ​​If the same repayment arrangement that was set up for the Phase I loans was extended to the Phase 2a loans; then at least part of repayment for the loan is being made from the operating revenue of the railway line; which is deposited into an escrow account that was set up jointly by the Government of Kenya and Eximbank (12).

The China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economics and Technical Cooperation (CJIC) completed the project in 2020. 

CJIC won the US$137.5M contract for the 50MW Garissa Solar Power project in 2016 (1). The project is a turn-key project and a consortium of four major engineering companies will implement civil; mechanical and electrical works (2).  The intention was to begin construction work in July 2016; but it was delayed to October 2016 with the goal of installing the 55MW by February 2018 (3). 

According to China Ministry of Foreign Affairs (FMPRC) and the Kenyan ePromis Debt Register; the project was financed through a US$138M concessional loan agreement; provided by China Eximbank; from that year (4). The Government of Kenya put forth a tender via the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum; specifically the Rural Electrification Authority (REA) put forth a tender to provide local consultancy services for the project (2). REA officially led the project’s development and signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Kenya Power company; a electricity utility company. Under this contract; Kenya power purchases kWh/12 shillings and this is 8 shillings cheaper than electricity from diesel (5). 

CJIC completed the project in January 2020. The Garissa Solar Power project increased renewable energy contributions to the Garissa grid to 93%. The plant has 200 solar panels connected to inverters and installed on an 85 hectares area (5).

"KE.041","Completed",2014,"Kenya","Government","Eximbank","CL",1600,"2",,7,"20","SGR Phase I - Mombasa to Nairobi; 472.3km (CL portion; total 3.6bn)","Transport","China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC)",,"NARRATIVE: On May 11; 2014; the Government of Kenya signed a US$1.6B semi-concessional loan agreement with China Eximbank for Phase I of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) project (1). The US$1.6B loan agreement was one of two loan agreements signed with China Eximbank that day; the other being for a US$2B commercial loan (1) (KE.030). The two loans were used to construct 473 km of railway tracks between Mombasa and Nairobi and procure trains from China (2). Contractor China Road and Bridge Corporation began construction in 2013 and Phase I was completed in 2017 (3)(4).
 
The Standard Gauge Railway project is a regional effort to connect Kenya; Uganda; Rwanda and South Sudan by rail (5). In 2013; the four countries signed an agreement to undertake the project (6). Each country is responsible for constructing the portion of the project that runs through its territory; but Kenya is the only country to have begun implementation of its share of the project. Plans for the railway network have been altered and restored to their original state as the four countries have threatened to withdraw from the project or refused to connect their tracks to those of their neighbors (7). At present; however; it appears that all three of Kenya’s partners plan to implement the project (8)(9). The return on Kenya’s investment into the network will depend on its partner countries’ contributions to the project (6).
 
Kenya’s contribution to the SGR project was divided into two phases with a combined cost of US$13B (1). Phase I included two components. First; the construction of 473 km of railway tracks between Mombasa and Nairobi with three major stations at Mombasa; Voi; and Nairobi; as well as 23 crossing stations (5). Second; the procurement of 56 diesel locomotives; 16240 wagons; and 40 coaches from China (3). Phase II included three components. Phase 2a was for the construction of 120 km of railway tracks between Naivasha. Phase 2b called for the construction of a railway line between Naivasha and Kisumu and the development of a high-capacity port at Kisumu. Phase 2c was for the construction of a railway line between Kisumu and Malaba (10). So far; Phases I and 2a have been completed (4)(11).
 
Although the SGR project was first conceived by the government of former Kenyan President; Mwai Kibaki; it was Kibaki’s successor; President Uhuru Kenyatta; who pushed the idea ahead despite much resistance and invested considerable political capital into the project (6). Proponents of the project point to the SGR’s potential to decrease transportation costs for freight by 60% and the reduction of travel time between Mombasa and Nairobi from 30 to 8 hours (12). The Kenyan opposition and some economists have criticized the increase in Kenya’s external debt that has come with the Eximbank loans that funded the project (13). In the coastal regions of Kenya; many have lamented the negative impact of a decision to ship all containerized cargo by rail; arguing that the decision forced logistics businesses to move their operations away from the coast to inland container depots (14). A 2013 cost benefit analysis conducted by the World Bank; concluded that the SGR project was not economically viable (15).
 
In 2014; Kenya’s President Kenyatta visited China and signed the Memorandum of Understanding for financing of the SGR (6). The signing ceremony for the loan agreement on May 11; 2014; was attended by President Kenyatta; the Chinese Prime Minister; Li Kequiang; the President of Uganda; Yoweri Museveni; the President of Rwanda; Paul Kagame; and the President of South Sudan; Salva Kiir (2). The US$1.6B semi-concessional loan has an interest rate of 2%; a term of 20 years; and a grace period of 7 years (12). Eximbank took a number of steps to secure its investment. The Government of Kenya was required to guarantee the loan and confirm that it had the necessary funds to cover its contribution to the project’s costs; including the funds for land acquisition and relocation (12). Insurance for the loan was provided by Sinosure. In order to cover the costs of land acquisition and interest rate payments during the grace period; the Government of Kenya began levying a new tax of 1.5% on imported goods that flowed into a Railway Development Fund (RDF) (6)(12). At least part of repayment for the loan is being made from the operating revenue of the railway line; which is deposited into an escrow account that was set up jointly by the Government of Kenya and Eximbank (12). Originally; the operator of the line was to be chosen by public tender; but this arrangement must have been altered when China Communications Construction Company (CCCC); CRBC’s parent company; was awarded the operating contract for the SGR (6). There was no competitive bidding on this contract. Public tendering had already been foregone in the case of the construction contract because Eximbank had made the provision of its loan conditional on the requirement that the project be contracted to a Chinese company (6)(12). In order to circumvent Kenya’s procurement laws; Kenya’s executive insisted that the construction contract for the SGR was a “government-to-government” procurement which does not require competitive bidding under Kenyan law (1).
 
The SGR has been at the center of numerous lawsuits that have threatened the existence of the project itself and led to the arrest of senior Kenyan officials. The first of these disputes concerns CRBC’s construction contract. In 2014; only a few months after construction of Phase I began; an activist; Okiya Omtatah; and the Law Society of Kenya attempted to have the construction contract rescinded on the grounds that procurement laws had been violated (4). Simultaneously; two parliamentary committees investigated the procurement process and Kenya’s Attorney General issued an opinion in which he disagreed with the interpretation of “government-to-government” procurement in the case of the construction contract (1). The lawsuit was dismissed by Kenya’s High Court in 2014 and the parliamentary committees accepted the “government-to-government” interpretation of the procurement process and cleared the project individually in February and April 2014; only weeks before the loan signing on May 11 (1)(4). Construction resumed in December 2014. In June 2020; approximately 3 years after Phase I was completed; Kenya’s Court of Appeals ruled that CRBC’s construction contract was illegal because there had been no public tendering for the contract (4). Although it is unclear how this ruling will affect the SGR project; one of the activists at the Law Society of Kenya suggested that the ruling by the appeals court may be a preparatory step for the Government of Kenya to “plead illegality at an international arbitration should China Road and Bridge Corporation sue for breach of contract.” (4)
 
The second legal dispute pertained to Phase 2a of the SGR. In September 2016; Kenya’s National Environment Tribunal issued a stop order on construction for Phase II after it was revealed that plans for Phase 2a; which traverses Nairobi National Park; had been finalized without conducting the compulsory Environmental Impact Assessment (16). The stop order was upheld by Kenya’s High Court on October 4; 2016; but construction of Phase II began on October 20; 2016; in spite of the court order. In April 2017; activist Okiya Omtatah and the Kenya Coalition for Wildlife obtained another court order and construction was halted (16). In August 2017; Kenya’s Transport Secretary; James Macharia; reported that construction would resume in 14 days; following a ruling by Kenya’s National Environmental Tribunal; which the Secretary anticipated would be favorable (17). Construction of Phase 2a was completed in October 2019 and the Tribunal’s verdict in favor of the Government of Kenya was upheld by the Lands and Environment Court in July 2021 (18).
 
The third legal controversy in connection with the SGR concerns allegations of corruption. In 2018; the Kenyan prosecutor’s office named 18 officials; businesspeople; and companies that had allegedly been involved in a scheme that involved the issuance of false compensation claims for land used by the SGR. These claims were used to divert funds that should have been utilized for the railway. Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri; the chairman of the National Land Commission; and Atanas Karikuri Maina; the managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation; were among those arrested. No Chinese individuals were arrested or named by the prosecutor (13).
 
In September 2020; a report issued by the transport committee of Kenya’s parliament urged the government to renegotiate the terms of the SGR loans as well as CCCC’s contract for operation of the line (19).

Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) started to implement the project as a part of a joint venture with Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (SMEDI) Co.; Ltd. 

On May 29; 2014; AVIC International and the Kenyan Ministry of Water and Irrigation signed a commercial contract for the Karimenu Water Supply project in Nairobi. The project includes the construction of a water plant; a dam and water pipes. At completion; it will supply 70;000 m3 of water daily to Nairobi. The project would be constructed in Gatundu North; Ruiru; Juja; and Kiambu county (1). AVIC would joined SMEDI to implement the general project; and Stecol Corp was the subcontractor for the construction of the water supply plant and pipelines. Athi Water Services is overseeing the project (2). Their proposed construction completion date was intended to be in December 2020. 

According to a Kiambu government press release; the Government of Kenya and China Eximbank signed a US$229M loan for financing the project in May 2017 (3). The government would also fund a portion of the project. However; the project was stalled for 2 years due to unsettled compensation for those that lived on the land of the project’s construction. The National Lands Commission claimed that the lack of compensation was due to computational errors so the residents later moved this to court. President Kenyatta intervened in the situation through the Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Water. They presented a new compensation package to those involved; however; it is unclear if that compensation went through (3).  

In July of 2020; the contractors were driven out of the Kiambu construction site by local residents again. According to the residents; the government had failed to compensate them on time. Residents have resorted to calling out to the National Land Commission to intervene. It is unclear when construction will resume (4).

(1) China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) handled construction; and officially launched the project on March 7; 2012. (2) 

In 2011; the Government of Mozambique awarded CRBC with  eUS$315M engineering; procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the Maputo Ring Road Project. CRBC aimed to complete the 74km two-way four-lane road within the span of 2.5 years; or 30 months. (4) The Maputo Ring road was meant to address traffic congestion in Maputo. The project was divided into 6 sections: Section I; extension of Avenida da Marginal (6.3 km); Section II: Construction of a road between the Costa do Sol neighborhood and the Marracuene district (19.9 km); Section III: Construction of a road from Chiango to Zimpeto (10.5 km); Section IV; expansion of the national road number One (EN1) fom Zimpeto to Marracuene (15.5 km); Section V; construction of a road of from Zimpeto to Tchumene; and Section VI; a road that will link Municipality of Matola to Praça (5.5 km). CRBC completed five of the six sections by 2015. (3) In 2018; Mozambique public company and project manager Maputo Sul could not pay to resettle the 500 households it would take to complete section (6). The Council of Ministers subsequently submitted a re-alignment of the road. (3) Furthermore; the government delayed putting in toll gates to collect the money to pay off the loan and maintenance costs until 2018. (4) 

CRBC completed the road in 2018; after adjusting for delays. (6) In 2019 the Minister of Public Works; Housing and Water Resources was calling for maintenance of the road; citing minimal work since CRBC handed over the project to Mozambique’s National Road Administration. (5)

This US$104M loan agreement was the first of two agreements that the Government of Mozambique concluded with Eximbank for the purpose of financing the repair of EN6; the second being a US312.4M concessional loan agreement signed in 2014 (MZ.068). Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Company (AFECC) completed the project in 2019 (2). 
 
On May 12; 2013; the Government of Mozambique’s Secretariat of the Council of Ministers ratified the loan (1). Plans for the US$416M project included the rehabilitation of bridges with a combined length of 1;652 meters and the construction of three toll plazas; two weigh bridges; six police checkpoints; 50 public transport stops; and seven aqueducts (3). At the time the project was conceived; the poor condition of EN6 was negatively impacting Mozambique’s trade with its neighbors. It was estimated that 3;000 trucks; mainly from Zambia; Malawi; Zimbabwe; and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; travelled EN6 daily on their way to and from the port of Beira and took four to five hours for a trip that should have taken them only one and a half hours to complete (4).
 
The groundbreaking ceremony for the repair of EN6 was held on July 10; 2014. It was attended by the President of Mozambique; Armando Gebuza; the CEO of AFECC; Wang Hao; and Counselor Wang of the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy. The project was originally intended to be completed within 36 months (5)(6).
 
There have been numerous delays and controversies associated with this project. The first delay was caused by an alleged “excess of banking bureaucracy”; which hampered the release of the first 30% tranche of the loan (6). AFECC was engaged in lengthy negotiations to remedy the situation. The project slowed down again in August 2015; due to a lack of sand and gravel (7). In addition; the procurement process for the project has upset local entrepreneurs. At a meeting with Mozambique’s Prime Minister; Carlos Agostinho do Rosario; businessmen from the Sofala region; where much of the project is being implemented; complained of having been excluded from this project (8).
 
The repair of EN6 was completed on November 14; 2019; more than two years behind schedule. The completion ceremony was attended by the President of Mozambique; Filipe Nyusi; and the Chinese Ambassador to Mozambique; Su Jian (2).

The loan has an interest rate of 2%; with a 7-year grace period and a maturity period of 20 years. The repayments are conducted semi-annually (2). The contractor is the Chinese company StarTimes. The digital migration project includes the construction of a digital transmission network covering the entire Mozambique; construction of the national TV station; and training of Mozambican technical personnels (3). The project will install a total of 18 digital television transmitters; with 10 in provincial capital cities and 8 in rural areas (4).

The Mozambique government initially set the deadline of the digital migration for June 2015; yet the progress was slowed due to a lack of finance. The Mozambican Minister for Transport and Communications travelled to Beijing in March 2016 to speed up the process and request the US$156M loan from the China Eximbank. In 2016; Startimes was awarded the construction contract (4).

The construction started in December 2018 (5). On October 8; 2020; the digital migration project was completed (6; 7).

This US$312.4M loan agreement was the second agreement that the Government of Mozambique concluded with Eximbank for the purpose of financing the repair of EN6; the first being a US$104M concessional loan agreement signed in 2013 (MZ.044). Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Company (AFECC) completed the project in 2019 (2). 
 
On February 2; 2014; the Government of Mozambique’s Secretariat of the Council of Ministers ratified the loan (1). Plans for the US$416M project included the rehabilitation of bridges with a combined length of 1;652 meters and the construction of three toll plazas; two weigh bridges; six police checkpoints; 50 public transport stops; and seven aqueducts (3). At the time the project was conceived; the poor condition of EN6 was negatively impacting Mozambique’s trade with its neighbors. It was estimated that 3;000 trucks; mainly from Zambia; Malawi; Zimbabwe; and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; travelled EN6 daily on their way to and from the port of Beira and took four to five hours for a trip that should have taken them only one and a half hours to complete (4).
 
The groundbreaking ceremony for the repair of EN6 was held on July 10; 2014. It was attended by the President of Mozambique; Armando Gebuza; the CEO of AFECC; Wang Hao; and Counselor Wang of the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy. The project was originally intended to be completed within 36 months (5)(6).
 
There have been numerous delays and controversies associated with this project. The first delay was caused by an alleged “excess of banking bureaucracy”; which hampered the release of the first 30% tranche of the loan (6). AFECC was engaged in lengthy negotiations to remedy the situation. The project slowed down again in August 2015; due to a lack of sand and gravel (7). In addition; the procurement process for the project has upset local entrepreneurs. At a meeting with Mozambique’s Prime Minister; Carlos Agostinho do Rosario; businessmen from the Sofala region; where much of the project is being implemented; complained of having been excluded from this project (8).
 
The repair of EN6 was completed on November 14; 2019; more than two years behind schedule. The completion ceremony was attended by the President of Mozambique; Filipe Nyusi; and the Chinese Ambassador to Mozambique; Su Jian (2).

TBEA signed the commercial contract with the Government of Uganda in 2017 and began construction in 2019. While the work was expected to conclude by the end of 2021; implementation has been delayed due to COVID-19 shutdowns; prolonged subcontracting process; and misunderstanding. TBEA contracted 45 local firms to execute the construction work. And they thought that the Resettlement Action Plan will be carried out by the Rural Electrification Agency while it was stipulated as their own responsibility in the contract; which has created delays [2].

"ZM.056","Completed",2014,"Zambia","Government","Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation (ZTE)","SC",103,,,,,"ZTE Take-over of Libya Lap Green's loans to Zamtel","ICT","Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation (ZTE)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2014; the Government of Zambia and China Eximbank signed a US$103M loan agreement for financing the purchase of Lap Green’s debt to Zhongxing Telecommunication Equipment Corporation (ZTE). The loan’s purpose and transaction was completed by the government in the same year. 

In 2010; the Government of Zambia sold a 75% stake in Zambia Telecommunications Company (Zamtel) to Lap Green Networks; a Libyan private company. Lap Green planned to revitalize Zamtel by completing the Zambian Global System of Mobile Communication (GSM) Phase IV project and the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) Project. They purchased 75% of Zamtel at US$257M through their own finance and a US$103M loan received from ZTE. In 2012; the Government of Zambia re-possessed Zamtel; claiming that the previous administration had sold the company illegally. 

Lap Green took the case to Lusaka’s High Court. The Zambian government decided to settle the case through a consent judgement to compensate the initial investment plus 8% interest. According to the agreement; the government would initially pay US$114M in November 2016 and then pay US$35M in February and August 2017. In the London High Court; the Libyan Investment Authority (ILA) also pursued legal action against the Government of Zambia for reversing the sale of Zamtel without compensation. Lap Green asked for US$480M in compensation; but the court ordered a compensation of US$380M. The compensation included paying off the US$103M loan Lap Green borrowed from ZTE (1). 

The Zambian Secretary of Treasury moved to secure a loan from China Eximbank to pay back ZTE on behalf of Lap Green. In December 2014; the Government signed a US$103M loan with China Eximbank to finance the “Take-over of Zamtel’s US$103M loan to ZTE (2).” This loan has since been scrutinized because it was requested at a time the Zambian Kwacha was depreciating and Zambia’s external debt was increasing (3).

In 2013; Zambia’s Ministry of Home Affairs signed a US$210M contract agreement with ZTE for the implementation of the Public Security Network Phase III project. The project allegedly became shrouded in corruption as the African Parliaments Network against Corruption (APNAC) accused the ministry of unfair bidding practices. APNAC reported that ZTE had received the contract without having gone through the bidding process. They urged the Ministry to explain their choice of ZTE; claiming that other bidders had lower costs (1). In September 2013; the Ministry terminated the contract based on these accusations of corruption. Ministry of Home Affairs Minister Edgar Lungu referred the incident to the Anti-Corruption Commission and the Auditor General at the Ministry of Justice for further investigations (2). Although this controversy initially stopped the project; the project was later revived through the provision of financing in 2016.

In 2016; the China Development Bank provided US$179M for financing the project (3).

In 2019; the contractor China Henan International Cooperation Group (CHICO) is implementing the project.
 
In 2012; CHICO signed the business contract to implement the Nkana Water and Sanitation project within a construction period of 18 months. Originally; the African Development Bank financed the first phase of the project. CHICO won the US$200M contract for phase II of the project in 2016 (1).
 
According to Zambia’s 2016 Annual Economic Report; ICBC provided US$169.64M for the implementation of the Nkana Water and Sanitation project (2). The project was meant to address water quality issues and improve service delivery in Kitwe; Chambishi and Kalulushi. While CHICO began implementing the project after the financing was finalized; funding issues led to the suspension of the project in 2019. CHICO claimed that it was owed US$30M and the Nkana Water and Sewerage Company was also owed K70M by government institutions due to unpaid water bills (3).
 
In October 2020; the mayor of Kitwe stated that the project is still being implemented by CHICO (4). The minutes of the Zambian National Assembly meeting held on November 4 indicates that this project is under implementation (5).

China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CCEC) is currently implementing the project.
 
The engineering; procurement and construction plus finance (EPC+F) contract for the project was signed in February 2016 (1). According to Global Trade Review; the Zambian Ministry of Finance achieved financial close for the project’s two loan facilities with the Bank of China; Standard Chartered Bank and Sinosure on July 11; 2016. The first was a US$382M syndicated loan with a 15 year tenor. The Bank of China provided US$322M of the loan; while Standard Chartered Bank provided US$50M. Altogether; the amount accounted for 95% of the project’s cost; which was a total of US$449M. Standard Chartered Bank provided the remaining US$67.3M of the total cost (2).
 
The Kafulafuta Reservoir Dam Water Supply Project entails the construction of a dam and infrastructure that can hold 123 million m3 of water for the supply of water in the province’s districts. It also includes repairing the old leaking pipes; construction of two pump stations; installing raw water pipelines to four treatment plants; as well as the extension of the pipe network to unserviced areas. At completion; the dam will generate 300;000 m3 of water per day. The project was positioned to create 6;000 jobs and was classified under the Bank of China’s Going Global and Belt and Road Initiatives (3).
 
CCEC began the preparation work for the project on June 23; 2017; and by that time; the Zambian government had disbursed up to 30% of the project’s cost. The project’s groundbreaking ceremony took place in the Copperbelt Province; Zambia; on Sept. 21; 2018; It was attended by President Lungu and the Chinese Ambassador to Zambia (4). In February 2020; the project was stalled and later resumed. CCEC claimed funding issues were the cause of suspension; but Zambian officials insisted that it was the rainy season that caused the delay (5). As of February 2021; the Kafulafuta Dam is 98% complete (6).

Sinohydro Bureau 11 is currently implementing the project. 

In 2003; ZESCO and Sinohydro signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the development of the KGL Hydropower Project at a cost of USD600M and China Eximbank was expected to finance 85% of the cost with the other 15% of the cost raised by ZESCO internally(1). Later; the Government of Zambia decided to implement this project as a Public Private Partnership project (2).

In August 2010; the Government of Zambia; Sinohydro; and China-Africa Development Fund (CADFUND) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the financing and construction of the KGL Hydropower Project on a Build; Own; Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis (3). A feasibility study funded by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was published in the same month (4). Originally; a special purpose vehicle (SPV) was established to build and operate the dam for 30 years (5). This SPV was split between different shareholders. ZESCO held 30% of the stake; Sinohydro held 50% and China-Africa Development Fund held 20% (6). However; the project ran into financial support issues and was re-tendered in 2013. Eventually; the other shareholders dropped out; and the project was left 100% owned by ZESCO. 

ZESCO initiated the international competitive bidding process in August 2013 by pre-qualifying interested contractors. Of the 11 interested contractors; ZESCO shortlisted five companies after conducting due diligence visits in 2014 through its subsidiary Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development. In April 2014; tender documents were released to all five companies; and the tender was closed in July 2014. ZESCO evaluated the bids from July 27; 2015 to August 6; 2015. They issued the final notice of award on September 7; 2015. However; before the Zambia Public Procurement Authority authorized ZESCO to continue with the award process; ZESCO began pre-contract discussions with Sinohydro. The contract was finalized from September 30; 2015 to October 8; 2015 and sent to the Attorney General; who approved it on October 14; 2015 (5).  

On October 19; 2015; ZESCO and Sinohydro signed the engineering procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydropower Project at a cost of US$2 billion (7). The government would contribute 15% of the project cost and released USD186M to ZESCO as a part of its contribution (7). Sinohydro started construction on January 15; 2016; however for 2 years the project was plagued with financing issues. In March 2017; Sinohydro began discussing the financing agreement terms with ICBC; China Eximbank; ZESCO and the Government of Zambia. The discussion took 7 months and included 87 loan conditions (8). On November 13; 2017; ZESCO finalized and signed the US$1.5B loan agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC to finance the construction of 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydropower Station (9). In 2018; an initial USD479M portion was disbursed from the Eximbank and ICBC syndicate; and by the end of 2018; a total of USD551M was disbursed (10). However; by June 2018; Sinohydro had only received 10% of the project cost from the Zambian side (11). 

The project aims to address Zambia’s power deficit. Zambia typically generates 1;400MW per hour of electricity and consumes an average of 800MW per hour. During peak times; demand increases to 1;500MW per hour (12). KGL is located 55km upstream from the confluence of the Kafue and Zambezi Rivers. The dam is 140m high and possesses a crest length of 8-10m. The power plant will be equipped with five 150MW turbines (13). As of 2017; Sinohydro had completed 24% of the project (14); and as of 2019; 67% of the project (15). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2020; but it was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2021; Sinosure made its first special insurance indemnity of more than US$ 57 million to PowerChina; Sinohydro’s parent company (16). The project is 91% complete in April 2021 (17). The first unit of the KGL hydropower station was commissioned on July 23; 2021 (18).

Huawei is currently implementing the project. 

In 2016; the Minister of Transport and Communication announced that they handed the US$280M project contract for phase II of the Communications Towers Project to Huawei Technologies Company. The project entailed constructing 808 new towers; building 1;009 2G/3G/4G wireless stations; and establishing transmission networks and user access terminals. The ministry began coordinating with Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA) to finalize where the communication towers would be installed. They planned for project implementation in areas not covered by phase I; which included eleven priority areas in Kasempa. In November 2016; Huawei; Zambia Telecommunication Company Limited (ZAMTEL) and Zambia Information & Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) celebrated the launch of the project (1). Huawei would complete the construction; and ZAMTEL would operate the system. The project was meant to boost mobile phone coverage in dense economic clusters and settlements in underserved and unserved areas. These areas include “rural health centers; schools; farming blocks; mines; tourism centers and rural trading centers.” However; the project could not proceed without funding. The government began finance negotiations with China Eximbank in 2016 to raise funding for the project (1) (2) (3) (4). 

On June 13; 2017; the project details were discussed in the Zimbabwe parliament. More specifically; parliament discussed the locations of the communication towers in the Nalolo constituency; and more broadly; they discussed the Ministry of Finance’s status on finalizing the agreement. According to the agreement; each 75m communication tower with 4G radio access and transmission would cost about USD285;000 (5). On August 7; 2017; the Government of Zambia and China Eximbank signed the framework loan agreement for the project. At the ceremony; Chinese Ambassador Yang Youming represented and signed for China Eximbank. President Lungu; Zambian officials from the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; along with Huawei representatives were also present (6). In the same year; the Government of Zambia signed a USD281M loan contract with the China Eximbank to finance the Communication Towers Project (7).

In the last quarter of 2017; Huawei began constructing the project. On March 7; 2018; the Minister of Transportation and Communications; Minister Mushimba; gave some updates to parliament. Up to that date; 15% of the project had been completed. At the end of 2018; 110 towers across the country’s regions had been constructed; of which 66 were functional (8). By March 2021; 790 out of 1009 towers (78%) were installed (4). Huawei continues to implement the project.

The supplier’s credit loan had a 5 year grace period and a 10 year term. Platinum reserves from Selous and Northfields were used as collateral on the loan. 

Zimbabwe received the equipment from China in 2011; which included 107 transformers and 440 water pumps. The government sold the equipment to farmers in exchange for payments. They expected to use the revenue from these sales to pay back the loan. However; many farmers did not pay the government for the equipment. Before the government could default on the loan in 2011; China extended the repayment period from 5 to 8 years (3).

Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group (AFECC) completed the project in 2012. 

On March 21; 2011; Zimbabwe’s Minister of Finance Tendai Biti and China Eximbank signed a CNY 675M concessional loan agreement for financing the construction of Zimbabwe’s National Defense College (NDC). The actual USD equivalency at the time of the loan signing was US$107M. The loan had a 2% interest rate; a 7 year grace period and a 20 year term. Under Article 9 of the agreement; China Eximbank required loan repayments be made through income from the State’s diamond revenues of the Sino-Zimbabwe Anjin joint mining venture at Chiadzwa. To secure the payment and repayment of the loan; China Eximbank required the government to first establish an escrow account with the revenue of Zimbabwe’s portion from Anjin Investments. Under article 2.5; Zimbabwe was required to purchase Chinese goods; technologies and services for the project. They could also purchase these goods from Zimbabwe if the purchases directly benefited the Ministry of Defense (1) (2). 

Both Houses of Parliament had to approve the loan first to render the agreement valid. Zimbabwe’s Minister of Lands and Rural Resettlement presented the loan on behalf of the Minister of Defense at the House of Assembly meeting on May 31; 2011. The loan agreement was quickly approved in the Senate after one question; but the House of Assembly debated on the agreement for 2 hours before it was approved. The Minister of Defense defended the loan by justifying the need to establish the NDC; pointing out the low interest rate of 2%; and stressing the generous grace and repayment periods. Members of Parliament complained about the loan; stating that it was presented on short notice and that it would further encourage Chinese companies to import materials and labor from China; thereby disadvantaging local suppliers and workers. They also had doubts about servicing the loan when Zimbabwe’s external debt was already US$7B and civil servants were going unpaid (1)(2). Despite the debate; the loan agreement was approved. 

On January 17; 2011; Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe; Xin Shunkang; inspected the project’s construction site with military inspector; Ju Hongbin and AFECC Chairman Jiang Qingde(3) (4). AFECC completed the project in 2012. On September 15; 2012; Robert Mugabe inaugurated the school at the opening ceremony in Harare. The NDC is expected to become the premier defense education center on national security. It will also house a think tank for strategic studies research for the National Security Council; the Ministry of Defense and other government departments (5).

China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) started constructing the project in 2013. 

In 2010; the Harare Municipal Government awarded CMEC an EPC contract worth US$144M for financing multiple water and sewage projects. Under the agreement; CMEC planned to renovate the Morton Jaffray Water Plant; Crow Borough Sewage Treatment Plant; Firle Sewage Treatment Plant and other clear water and sewage pump stations (1). On March 21; 2011; during Vice Premier Wang Qishan’s visit to Zimbabwe; the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank signed a US$141;346;392.15 loan facility agreement to finance these projects (2). The loan had a management fee of 0.375% for the contract amount and a commitment fee of 0.375% per annum. It also has a 0.5Libor+3% per annum interest rate; a grace period of 4 years and a 9 year term (3). The City of Harare instructed China Eximbank to make payments to CMEC through the Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. In addition to the water projects mentioned; the finance would cover the procurement of equipment; materials and water treatment chemicals needed for the project (3).

CMEC started working on the projects in 2013; with the intention to complete it in 36 months. In June 2013; China Eximbank disbursed the first US$72M portion of the loan. The remaining 50% of the loan was meant to be disbursed after certified invoices were submitted to indicate the project’s progress (4). However; CMEC faced issues with fund disbursements from 2014 to 2016. In 2014; auditors found that CMEC overpriced its labor by US$20M and the price for building equipment warehouses by US$1.9M. The auditors also questioned the purchase of 21 luxury vehicles; when the project’s contract indicated only 15 were needed (5). In September 2017; the Harare City Council stated it would start repaying the loan although the remaining US$72M had still not been disbursed (6).

In 2019; CMEC defended Harare City Council on allegations that they had diverted funds for the project. According to CMEC; US$8M of the funds were set aside to procure equipment; but only US$3M had been used for that equipment. CMEC denied that the US$1M in funds for the 21 luxury cars was a diversion of funds. They justified their release of funds for the purchase by citing the need for multiple cars due to the widespread location of the project. As a result of the scandal; Mayor Herbert Gomba suspended Town Clerk Tendai Mahachi; who was in charge of the commission on the project. The Minister of Local Government later suspended Mayor Gomba (7). 

In July 2019; CMEC complained that although the project was 90% finished; they were waiting on the government to pay the US$72M balance to complete the works (8).

The loan was portioned into a concessional loan and a preferential buyer’s credit loan. Sinohydro Bureau 11; a subsidiary of Power China completed the project in 2018.

On October 11; 2013; Power China signed a US$533M EPC contract with Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) to expand the Kariba South Bank Power Station. Under the agreement; China Eximbank would provide US$319M; 60% of the project’s total cost; to Zimbabwe’s Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) (1) (2). Part of the US$319M is a concessional loan and another part is a preferential export buyer’s credit facility (3). ZPC planned to provide the balance of US$213M from other development finance institutions to cover consultant services; supervision; water supply agreements and related costs. ZPC raised the money in different ways; including receiving US$60M from an unnamed bank and in seeking permission from bondholders to divert US$14M it raised for the Harare Power Station to the Kariba power station (2)(4). 

Sinohydro Bureau 11 started the project in 2014. They completed the first 150MW unit in December 2017 and the second 150MW unit in March 2018. Kariba’s expansion increased Zimbabwe’s power generation capacity from 750MW to 1050MW. On March 28; 2018; President Emmerson Mnangagwa inaugurated the project and praised the timely completion (5).

The amount is a US$219M equivalent. Huawei started implementing the project in 2015.

In 2012; the Government of Zimbabwe awarded Huawei the contract to execute NetOne’s National Mobile Broadband (NMBB) project. After the project contract signing; the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank initially signed a US$298M loan agreement (1). The loan was later finalized at US$219M (2). The loan has a 2% interest rate; a 5-8 year grace period and a 20 year term. NetOne opened an escrow account to deposit repayments (3). In December 2014; China Eximbank disbursed US$65M to kick off the project (4). Under the project; Huawei would deploy 2000 base stations and modernize NetOne’s GSM/W-CDMA network in  preparation for LTE platforms. 

Huawei’s competitor also provided a quote for the project; pricing it at US$100M. Upon seeing the cost variations in both quotes; Zimbabwe’s Finance Minister asked the Ministry of Transport; Communications and Infrastructural Development to reduce the project’s costs. The cost was negotiated down to US$219M. The Ministry of Information Communication Technology complained that the cost was still overpriced because the project had not been open to a public competitive tender. They hired Megawatt Energy in 2015; an South African based IT and energy consulting firm; to re-evaluate and renegotiate the deal. Megawatt’s evaluation found overpriced premiums in the project’s pricing. Megawatt recommended that Huawei should change its price offer from US$218;954;843 to US$140M. Huawei opposed the new price; citing that Megawatt’s CEO was a former president of ZTE; their competitor (AllAfrica). Huawei ultimately decided to refund NetOne US$30M through equipment (1).

Huawei completed the first stage of the expansion in 2015 with the expected completion year as 2016 (6).

The finance wasn’t finalized until 2017. Sinohydro aims to complete the project by 2022. 

On October 10; 2014; Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) and Sinohydro signed an US$1.147B EPC contract for the expansion of the Hwange Coal Power Station. Under the contract agreement; within 42 months Sinohydro planned to install two 300MW coal-fired units called Hwange 7&8; add a 20;000 cubic meter cistern; construct a 369km 400kV transmission line and 4 substations; and construct other supplementary infrastructure additions (1). 

During President Xi’s visit to Zimbabwe in December 2015; Xi and President Robert Mugabe witnessed the signing of several economic agreements. China Eximbank and Zimbabwe Ministry of Finance signed a preferential buyer’s credit loan agreement for financing the Hwange Coal Power Plant Expansion (2). China Eximbank would provide US$997.7M; which is 85% of the project’s cost; and the government of Zimbabwe would raise 15% to ensure a government down payment(3). The loan has a 2% interest rate; a 0.25% commitment and management fee; a 7 year grace period and a 20 year term (3). 

The loan agreement was presented to Zimbabwe’s parliament on December 7; 2016. During the senate meeting; the Minister of Finance and Economic Development laid out the terms of the agreement. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) held by the government and Sinohydro called Hwange Electricity Company (HESCO) would oversee the project’s development. HESCO is responsible for repayment on the principal loan and interest from electricity sales. The 15% required finance from the government; US$176M; would be paid to Sinohydro through equity. HESCO would enter into a purchase power agreement with Zimbabwe’s Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company to sell electricity from the Hwange 7&8 thermal power stations. ZPC would also raise US$307M for the project’s development costs. They were also seeking insurance from Sinosure and suitable tariffs on the exports for both the consumer and producer. The project would be implemented over a 3.5 year period (3). The senate debated the terms of the loan and approved it that month. 

In early 2017; the Government of Zimbabwe experienced issues with disbursement. Although Zimbabwe fulfilled 15 of China’s requirements for the loan including ratifying the deal in December 2016; signing the on-lending agreement in April 2017 and signing the power purchase agreement in May 2017; they had not financially closed the deal. Other conditions included a shareholder agreement between ZPC; Sinohydro and HESCO; a coal supply agreement between HESCO and Makomo Resources; and a limestone supply agreement between HESCO and PPC Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority also approved a tariff of 11c kWh(4). By February 2017; ZPC hadn’t secured the US$350M in finance for the project’s development. ZPC first tried to raise the money through a deal with Botswana; but it failed (5). The government was also participating in the talks to get Sinosure insurance which was contingent on the ability to raise a substantial amount of the 15% down payment. Another issue blocking the loan’s release was that Zimbabwe owed China US$40M (6). In January 2018; ZPC was able to raise US$116M of the US$350M from Standard Bank of South Africa (US$40M) and Afreximbank (US$76M) (7). This led to financial closure on the loan. 

In Jun 2018; China Eximbank disbursed the first US$200M to Sinohydro for the project (8). The project’s implementation has been disrupted by an escrow account scandal related to the Robert Mugabe International Airport and the Covid-19 pandemic. Sinohydro still plans to complete the project by 2022 (9).

The loan was portioned into a concessional loan and a preferential buyer’s credit loan. Sinohydro Bureau 11; a subsidiary of Power China completed the project in 2018.

On October 11; 2013; Power China signed a US$533M EPC contract with Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) to expand the Kariba South Bank Power Station. Under the agreement; China Eximbank would provide US$319M; 60% of the project’s total cost; to Zimbabwe’s Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) (1) (2). Part of the US$319M is a concessional loan and another part is a preferential export buyer’s credit facility (3). ZPC planned to provide the balance of US$213M from other development finance institutions; to cover consultancy services; supervision; water supply agreements and related costs. ZPC raised the money in different ways including receiving US$60M from an unnamed bank and in seeking permission from bondholders to divert US$14M it raised for the Harare Power Station to the Kariba power station (2)(4). 

Sinohydro Bureau 11 started the project in 2014. They completed the first 150MW unit in December 2017 and the second 150MW unit in March 2018. Kariba’s expansion increased Zimbabwe’s power generation capacity from 750MW to 1050MW. On March 28; 2018; President Emmerson Mnangagwa inaugurated the project and praised the timely completion (5).

NBE will distribute the funds (1); which come with a term period of 8 years; and an interest rate of 3.75% above libor. The facility matured in 2020. 

The short-lived post-Arab Spring government of Mohamed Morsi secured the loan during a two-country trip to China and Iran in August 2012 (2). President Morsi and President Hu Jintao signed the loan framework on August 28 (3). No parliamentary approval for the loan could be obtained; as during mid-2012 Morsi jockeyed with the military over the finer points of the constitution; including whether Morsi could convene Parliament. As a result; Morsi and the military council acted without a legislative branch for most of 2012 (4). The loan comes at a 3.75% above LIBOR interest rate; with a three-year grace period and 8 year maturity. (5) The National Bank of Egypt included the loan facility in its 2013-2014 budget sheets; recording an owed amount of around 91 million USD; which may indicate incomplete disbursements. (6) 

In their most recent annual report in 2018; NBE indicated they owed CDB 861;669;311.32 USD (with 2018 EGP-USD exchange rates);(7) aggregating additional small-business loans the Central Bank took from CDB. NBE has begun repayments of the loans; but indicated that the facilities hold variable interest rates.

(CREC)",,"NARRATIVE: On January 16; 2019; China Eximbank and Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) signed an agreement for two loans to finance the 10th Ramadan City to Cairo Third Line light rail. One loan amounted to $739 million at a 1.8% interest rate (EG.021); with the other loan amounting to $461 million at a 2% interest rate (EG.042) (1).

Egypt’s NAT went through several rounds of negotiations to support this loan facility - designed to fund projects that would alleviate congestion and support Egypt’s infrastructure and green initiatives (2). The government of Egypt signed a framework agreement with China’s Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) in 2014 to finance a series of projects; most prominently the 10th Ramadan City to Cairo Third Line light rail; one of the “first batch of projects for China-Egypt capacity cooperation” in 2015 (3). Negotiations over the light rail financing continued into 2017; when it was reported that the project would be partly financed by a $700 million loan from Eximbank; with Egypt covering the remainder of the cost (4). The $1.2 billion construction contract was signed on August 15; 2017 between Egypt’s NAT; China’s AVIC International and China Railway Group (3).

However; Egypt was still negotiating the loan details with Eximbank; and hoped to add another $500 million tranche to cover what was originally going to be Egypt’s share of the project costs (5). Egypt and Eximbank did not end negotiations until January 2019; when the final agreement was signed for the two loans: $739 million at an interest rate of 1.8% and $461 million at an interest rate of 2% (1). Both loans had a maturity of 15 years with a 5 year grace period. 

China Railway Group Ltd. (CREC) is the lead contractor while Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) is providing telecommunications; signals; and control work for the project. (5) The loan facility is funding 67 kilometers of light rail track; along with 11 stations and all related power and telecommunications infrastructure; designed to connect downtown Cairo with the new administrative capital. (6) Construction started in the beginning of 2018. China Railway Group Ltd (CREC) led the project and provided rail cars for the metro system. (6) CREC later partnered with Shenzhen Metro International for the project. (7) The contractors estimated building the rail and stations would take 24 months to complete. At the end of the 24 month construction period; AVIC will hold a 10-year maintenance contract to operate the rail line. (7) The track will stretch 67 kilometres from Salam City at Adly Mansour Station; on the outskirts of Cairo proper;(7) to the New Administrative Capital. 

Construction ran behind schedule; and the Egyptian State Information Service reported in April 2020; around 24 months after construction started that workers had not yet completed the project. The Egyptian Transport Minister in April 2020 urged officials to “intensify work and finalize the establishment of stations while at the same time taking all preventative measures against the novel Coronavirus.” (8) The Egyptian Ministry of Transport and China’s Ambassador to Egypt publicly inspected work on the line in September 2020; with the Egyptian government pressing for an October 2021 completion date.

"EG.042","Implementation",2019,"Egypt","Government","Eximbank","Loan",461,"2",,5,"15","Cairo-10th of Ramadan-New Administrative Capital Light Rail; 68km (Second Loan; total $1.2 billion)","Transport","Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC); China Railway Group Ltd. (CREC)",,"NARRATIVE: On January 16; 2019; China Eximbank and Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) signed an agreement for two loans to finance the 10th Ramadan City to Cairo Third Line light rail. One loan amounted to $739 million at a 1.8% interest rate (EG.021); with the other loan amounting to $461 million at a 2% interest rate (EG.042) (1).

Egypt’s NAT went through several rounds of negotiations to support this loan facility - designed to fund projects that would alleviate congestion and support Egypt’s infrastructure and green initiatives (2). The government of Egypt signed a framework agreement with China’s Export-Import Bank (Eximbank) in 2014 to finance a series of projects; most prominently the 10th Ramadan City to Cairo Third Line light rail; one of the “first batch of projects for China-Egypt capacity cooperation” in 2015 (3). Negotiations over the light rail financing continued into 2017; when it was reported that the project would be partly financed by a $700 million loan from Eximbank; with Egypt covering the remainder of the cost (4). The $1.2 billion construction contract was signed on August 15; 2017 between Egypt’s NAT; China’s AVIC International and China Railway Group (3).

However; Egypt was still negotiating the loan details with Eximbank; and hoped to add another $500 million tranche to cover what was originally going to be Egypt’s share of the project costs (5). Egypt and Eximbank did not end negotiations until January 2019; when the final agreement was signed for the two loans: $739 million at an interest rate of 1.8% and $461 million at an interest rate of 2% (1). Both loans had a maturity of 15 years with a 5 year grace period. 

China Railway Group Ltd. (CREC) is the lead contractor while Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) is providing telecommunications; signals; and control work for the project. (5) The loan facility is funding 67 kilometers of light rail track; along with 11 stations and all related power and telecommunications infrastructure; designed to connect downtown Cairo with the new administrative capital. (6) Construction started in the beginning of 2018. China Railway Group Ltd (CREC) led the project and provided rail cars for the metro system. (6) CREC later partnered with Shenzhen Metro International for the project. (7) The contractors estimated building the rail and stations would take 24 months to complete. At the end of the 24 month construction period; AVIC will hold a 10-year maintenance contract to operate the rail line. (7) The track will stretch 67 kilometres from Salam City at Adly Mansour Station; on the outskirts of Cairo proper;(7) to the New Administrative Capital. 

Construction ran behind schedule; and the Egyptian State Information Service reported in April 2020; around 24 months after construction started that workers had not yet completed the project. The Egyptian Transport Minister in April 2020 urged officials to “intensify work and finalize the establishment of stations while at the same time taking all preventative measures against the novel Coronavirus.” (8) The Egyptian Ministry of Transport and China’s Ambassador to Egypt publicly inspected work on the line in September 2020; with the Egyptian government pressing for an October 2021 completion date.

The Harbin Power Company was contracted to the project; (1) initially to provide the turbines and hydroelectric equipment for the dam. Two years later; Sudan would borrow an additional $381 million to contract Harbin Power Company to then link the dam to the nation’s power grid. (See SD.077)
 
The Al-Bashir government spent significant financial and political capital to construct the Merowe Project. In addition to China; The Arab Fund; Saudi Fund; Abu Dhabi and Kuwaiti Funds for development also contributed to the project; while Oman and Qatar gave more direct bilateral aid to the project. (1) However; the project quickly became mired in controversy due to forced removals of people living on the land; the flooding of largely unstudied archaeological ruins;(2)  and violence against protestors demonstrating against the projects. (3) Harbin Power Company won the project following its work on the el-Jaili gas power station (See SD.059) some 500km to the south. (4) 
 
Following an additional project in 2005 to connect the dam to the power grid (See SD.077); Sudan commissioned the dam in 2009 (5); and continues to produce substantial electricity for the nation: the dam provided 42% of Sudan’s total energy produced in-country during the first half of 2016. (6) However; issues with silt and debris accumulation threaten the long-term life of the project. The dam has lost 1.7% of its holding capacity since construction (5).

The project required restarting in 2009; when a modified agreement was signed. (2) The 463 million USD loan holds a maturity of 10 years; with a four-year grace period and an interest rate of 4.0%. (3) 

While initially signed in 2005; work re-started on the project in 2010 due to issues with wear on the material; and substantial political unrest between Sudan and what became South Sudan in 2011. (4) Sinomach worked with Sudan National Water Company; a State Owned Enterprise (SOE) on the project. The restart of the project also raised the total project cost to 509 million USD; of which the loan covered 463 million. (3)

While Sinomach and its partners started work on the project; its full scope and completion is unclear. However; the project was slated to take 3 years.

They signed on the project on April 6; 2010; (1) The total project value comes to 838 million USD; for which Sudan approached international donors for financing in 2011 and 2012. (2) The Chinese government provided $104 million of the 1.9 billion USD project; around 7% of the total project cost. (3)

President Omar Al-Bashir showed personal interest in the 1.9 billion USD project; being present at the signing (1) and the First Vice President surveying construction progress in 2013. (4) While China Water and Electric Corporation led the project; they sub-contracted Guiyang Engineering Corporation for the electromechanical EPC design. (5) Additionally; the French Company Solaria consulted; while the Germany company Lahmeyer International supervised construction. Sudan also sought outside funding; in addition to Chinese financing. The Sudanese government secured several loans from the Arab Development Fund; (6) equivalent to around $85 million USD. (6) Sudan also sought financing directly from the Kuwaiti government; securing another $83 million USD from the Kuwaiti Fund. (7) These loans represented financing for parts of the Atbara and Setit Hydropower complex which China’s loan did not cover. CWE and Chinese financing explicitly covered only the civil and hydromechanical works involved.(8) The project was estimated to take 65 months (5.4 years) to complete. 

President Omar Al-Bashir inaugurated the completed twin dam complex on February 16; 2017. (9).

(1) The $612 million USD loan facility covered 90% of the project cost of $680 million USD(2). 

Shanghai Electric Power Company (SEPCO) initially won the contract to construct the 300 MW gas power plant; along with three other power stations in 2009. Contracting shifted in 2011 to China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC); Shanghai Power Erection No. 1; and China 17th Metallurgical Group Co. (MCC17) in 2010;(3) CMEC acted as the general contractor; and Shanghai Power Erection No. 1 was responsible for overall contracting; (4) and MCC17 directed civil engineering and steelworks. (5) By 2012; the contractor estimated the plant was 50% complete; while ongoing restiveness in South Kordofan undermined work on the project and delayed completion; (6) initially estimated for 2014. (7) in 2013; the Sudanese government added a power and transmission line construction to the project; sub-contracted to the China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co. Ltd. (8); in efforts to fulfill the project’s original intentions of bringing greater power generation to the South Kordofan State and Darfur. 

Satellite imagery shows the Chinese companies finished their work by 2017; as confirmed by satellite imagery. (9) Sudan later added on to the power plant; and sought a syndicated loan from the Kuwait development fund for that purpose in 2019. (10)

(1) The loan carries a 3% interest rate and a 15 year maturity. (2) The project is part of the $3 billion USD multi-sector infrastructure oil-backed line of credit; sometimes referred to as the “6-road 1-bridge” agreement; committed to the government of Sudan via Eximbank in 2007. (3) China Machinery Import & Export Company (which later became China Machinery Engineering Corporation - CMEC) and China Xian Electric Company (CXEC) executed the contract. (4)

The contract included 630km of transmission lines; 8 new substations and the expansion of 3 existing substations. (1) CMEC and CXEC formed a joint venture to work on the project; creating China Xidian Electric (CXD). (5) The project stalled for a while; when the Sudanese Cabinet delayed full ratification of the project; despite CXD beginning the delivery of necessary parts. (5) All issues were resolved and work fully resumed by 2013. (6) 

The project ultimately connected the al-Fulah gas power plant to the rest of Sudan’s electric grid. In 2017 the project became the focus of public discontent after the Sudanese operators sold equipment designed to operate the plant - and promises of greater electricity connection to South Kordofan and Darfur from the project only marginally materialized.

(CNEEC)",,"NARRATIVE: In 2009; the Botswana Power Company (BPC); a state-owned enterprise; signed an export buyer’s credit facility agreement worth US$825 million with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for the purpose of constructing the Morupule B coal-fired power station (1)(2). Morupule B was completed by contractor China Nuclear Engineering and Construction Company (CNEEC) in 2014 (3).
 
On June 15; 2009; Ewetse Rakhudu; Chairman of BPC; and Jiang Jianping; President of ICBC; signed an export credit facility agreement worth US$825 million (2). The loan was extended through a consortium made up of ICBC and Standard Bank of South Africa; but the full loan amount was provided by ICBC; with Standard Bank contributing a cross-currency swap to convert US$ funding into Botswana Pula funding (4). The loan has a grace period of 3.5 years; a term of 20 years and an interest rate of LIBOR “plus a market-based margin” (5). China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) guaranteed 95% of repayment for the first 15 years of the loan; while the World Bank guaranteed the last 5 years of repayment through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)(6). The ICBC loan was intended to fund 85% of the US$970 million cost of CNEC’s EPC contract; with the additional 15% of funding covered by the Government of Botswana and BPC (5).
 
The Morupule B project was proposed as a way to decrease Botswana’s reliance on electricity imports and fuel economic growth. In 2008; Botswana relied on its neighbors for 80% of its energy needs (7). 70% of Botswana’s electricity that year was provided by Eskom of South Africa; which indicated that it would reduce supply through 2012 and cease supplying electricity to Botswana in 2013 (6). Considering Botswana’s substantial coal reserves (6) and the fact that 20% of the country’s energy was generated by the outmoded and increasingly volatile Morupule A power station; the decision was reached to expand Morupule by adding another power station (7). Morupule B was to include four generator units capable of producing 600MW of electricity (8). The expansion of Morupule included three components: construction of the power station; construction of the transmission system; and construction of a water supply system (5). Following a process of competitive international bidding that began in 2007; CNEEC was tasked with constructing one component of the project: the power station (6).
 
The project has been plagued by delays and controversies. Construction was expected to commence in 2010; with an expected completion date in 2012. Reports indicate that the first units of Morupule B were in fact commissioned in 2012; but were taken offline shortly thereafter in early 2013 when technical deficiencies became apparent (9). In January 2014; Kitso Mokaila; Botswana’s Minister of Minerals; Energy and Water Resources; announced that STEAG Energy Services; a German company; had been hired to “identify problems created by CNEEC and rectify them.” (10) BPC’s chief operating officer; Jacob Raleru; said STEAG had been contracted after BPC failed to reach a consensus with CNEEC; whose contract for maintenance and operation of Morupule ended in January 2014 (10). The World Bank reported that units 1; 3; and 4 of Morupule B had been tested and commissioned as of April 2014 (3). In 2016; BPC appeared eager to sell the power station to China Machinery Engineering Company (CMEC); but abandoned talks in 2018. Morupule B was operating at 81% capacity at the time (11). In 2019; the Botswana newspaper Sunday Standard claimed that they had obtained a
copy of a report that proved that at least BWP1000 million (US$150 million) of the Morupule B budget had been misappropriated. The newspaper alleged that key staff members of BPC had colluded with CNEEC to embezzle the money (12).

On March 14; 2012; Balbiena Pienaar; Deputy Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Engineering and Transportation of the Namibian Government signed commercial contracts with representatives of both CMEC and CGG for NAD 419 million (US$50 million) and NAD 722 million (US$85 million) respectively (2). China Eximbank provided the NAD 1142 million (US$135 million) concessional loan that was used to finance the two contracts at a 2% interest rate with a 5-year grace period and a 15-year term (1). The President of Namibia; Hifikepunye Pohamba; gave a speech at the groundbreaking ceremony for MR67 on May 16; 2013 (1) and construction on both roads began in July 2013 (3). 
 
Pohamba has emphasized the benefits that will come from connecting Namibia to the markets of Angola via the two roads (4). Favorable voices in the press have also highlighted the advantages of connecting the Port of Walvis Bay with southern Angola; adding that tourists will likely find Etosha National Park more accessible (5). Critical voices; however; allege that the costs of the projects were inflated and conjecture that there was no competitive bidding on the contracts for the two roads (6). China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stressed the positive effects of the projects on the local population and businesses (7). They claim that the MR67 project alone employed about 400 locals; with 25% of the contract value subcontracted out to local SME’s (7).
 
Both projects were completed within the agreed time frame. MR67 was completed in June 2015 and DR3608 was completed in July 2016 (3). On August 19; 2015; China’s Ambassador to Namibia; Xin Shunkang; the President of Namibia; Hage Geingob; former President; Pohamba; as well as various ministers; governors; and other officials attended the ceremony that marked the completion of the MR67 (7).

The Namibian Government is the sole shareholder in Epangelo (3). Taurus Minerals has a 90% stake in Swakop and is itself 60% owned by the Chinese state-owned enterprise China Nuclear Power Group (CGNPC) and 40% owned by the China Development Bank (2)(4). With its purchase of a 10% stake in Swakop Uranium; Epangelo has acquired 10% ownership of the Husab uranium mine in western Namibia; which began producing Uranium Oxide in 2016 (5).
 
Xin Shunkang; Chinese Ambassador to Namibia; attended the signing ceremony of the overarching agreement entered into by Epangelo and Swakop Uranium on October 18; 2011 (1). Swakop Uranium’s corporate strategy and business development manager; Grant Marais; has been quoted in the press as saying that Swakop Uranium offered Epangelo a loan at a commercial interest rate with repayment to be made over 15 years from the dividends of the Husab mine (4). The Agreement between Epangelo and Swakop Uranium came about after the Government of Namibia announced in April; 2011 that Epangelo would have exclusive control over new strategic minerals development in Namibia. It was also during this time that Epangelo began purchasing stakes in other mining operations and partnering with foreign firms engaged in mining activities within Namibia (2)(4). 
 
Swakop Uranium received its mining license for Husab mine in November 2011; roughly a month after Swakop Uranium signed the agreement with Epangelo (2). Mine development commenced in May; 2014; and Husab produced its first drum of Uranium Oxide in December; 2016 (2)(5). Husab was projected to increase its output to 5500 tU per year by 2020; with most of that output going to China and up to 20% to be sold on international markets by CGN Global Uranium (2). Estimates of the overall capital investment in Husab mine vary; with reports ranging from approximately US$1660 million (2) to in excess of US$2000 million (5). Ambassador Xin Shunkang has told the press that the investment in Swakop Uranium is China’s single largest investment in Africa (4).

On October 3; 2016; Eskom Group Chief; Brian Molefe; signed the US$500 million loan agreement with CDB (1).
 
An Eskom press release from October 2016 indicated that the CDB loan had increased Eskom’s funding for the financial year 2016/2017 to R51 billion (US$3.7 billion); 75% of Eskom’s R69 billion (US$5 billion) funding requirement for that year (1). The same press release stated that the CDB loans would go toward Eskom’s capital expenditure program and Molefe; in his speech at the signing ceremony; alluded to the projects at Kusile and Medupi (1).

"ZA.016","Implementation",2016,"South Africa","Transnet SOC Ltd (Transnet) (SOE)","BoC","CommL",219,,,,,"Transnet Club Loan - Bank of China 2016","Transport",,,"NARRATIVE: In 2015; Transnet; a South African state-owned enterprise; signed a commercial loan agreement worth R3000 million (US$219 million) with Bank of China (BoC) (1) for financing the procurement of 1064 locomotives. BoC disbursed the entire amount to Transnet in 2016 (2); but the locomotive procurement program itself is on hold until the High Court of South Africa decides whether or not to grant Transnet’s request to set aside the procurement contracts (3).
 
The BoC loan was part of a R12000 million (US$876 million) club loan that Transnet took out in order to procure 1064 locomotives and includes contributions from Absa (US$219 million); Nedbank (US$219 million); Futuregrowth Asset Managers (US$110 million); and Old Mutual Specialised Finance (US$110 million) in addition to BoC’s R3000M (US$219 million) (4). Transnet signed separate loan agreements with every individual participant in the club loan; but the individual agreements included the same “commercial terms” (4).
 
In 2013; Transnet initiated its Market Demand Strategy (MDS); a R337 billion (US$24.6 billion) investment program that included a plan to expand its fleet by 1064 locomotives (5). It awarded contracts for the locomotives’ construction to China North Railway (CNR); China South Railway (CSR); Bombardier Transportation; and General Electric Technologies (GE) in 2014 (4). In 2015; the same year that Transnet signed the loan agreements with the participants in the club loan; Transnet acquired additional funding for its procurement program from China Development Bank (CDB); Export Development Canada; Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW); and US Eximbank (4).
 
Progress on the program associated with the loan; however; has been slow. A press report from March 2021 alleged that CSR; CNR; and Bombardier Transportation had all failed to deliver the number of locomotives they had been contracted for within the agreed timeframe (6). Also in 2021; Transnet asked the High Court of South Africa to review and set aside the procurement contracts for the 1064 locomotives it had planned to acquire from CNR; CSR; Bombardier; and General Electric. Transnet claimed that the previous management and board of Transnet had failed to adhere to the minimum standards for fair; equitable; and competitive procurement processes (3).

The loan agreement between the China Eximbank and Benin was then signed on July 12; 2016 and ratified by the Beninese National Assembly on December 6; 2016 (2). In the passed version of the loan agreement on the Adjarala dam; the Eximbank will provide Benin a $270 million credit facility; consisting of a $59 million concessional loan and a $211 preferential buyer’s credit (3; 6). The dam is located between the borders of Benin and Togo along the Mono river. (3) The total cost of the dam was estimated to be about 266 billion CFA (equivalent to USD550 million). (4) However; due to its mounting debt pressure; the Togo government has not successfully mobilized its portion of the financing for the Adjarala Dam (4; 5). In 2017; the construction of the Adjarala dam was suspended due to a lack of a basin-wide environmental impact assessment (7).

Sinohydro is the main contractor. The construction contract was signed between Sinohydro and the Communauté Electrique du Bénin (CEB); an international organisation co-owned by the governments of Bénin and Togo. The construction started on December 26; 2015 and was planned to be finished within 50 months (8). The construction progress has been slowed due to the lack of finance; as many workers have been fired (9). 

Togo and Benin decided to build a shared dam in 1988 and have sought financing from multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank; the ADB; the AFD; and the IDB. But international financial institutions and the U.S. Congress rejected financing large-scale hydroelectric projects due to a lack of funds to mitigate the dam’s environmental and social impacts (5; 6; 10).

The loan was for financing the rehabilitation of the 72.1km Akassato-Bohicon Road in Benin. The project was completed on September 29; 2016.
 
In October 2012; the governments of China and Benin signed a framework agreement for the Akassato-Bohicon road rehabilitation project. On August 23; 2013; the Beninese Minister of Economy and Finance; Jonas Aliou Gbian; and the Chinese Ambassador of China to Benin; Tao Weiguang (on behalf of China Eximbank) [1] signed a concessional loan agreement for 800 million RMB to finance the 3rd portion (lot) of this project. This loan has a 1% interest rate; 0.25% commitment fee; 20-year maturity period; 7-year grace period; and 13-year repayment period [2]. Xinxing Corporation; the contractor and supplier; entered into a Commercial Contract with the Benin Ministry of Public Works and Transport on March 5; 2013 to implement this project [3]. The project is part of a regional objective to upgrade key transport infrastructure projects and improve existing road networks in the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States). The project includes 5 components: 1) technical studies for the road; 2) removal of old infrastructure that is to be upgraded and setting up newer infrastructures for the roadways; 3) conducting social and environmental management measures to assess environmental and social impacts of the project; 4) control and surveillance and monitoring of the road; 5) institutional support including training personnel; human resources; and computer materials. 
 
This loan represents the 3rd portion (lot) of the overall project. The 1st lot was a grant worth 92.6 million RMB form the Chinese government which was for reconstructing the first 4km of the Akassoto-Bohicon road (Akassato-Glo Gbtégbodji section). Lot 2 was in the form of a zero-interest loan also by the Chinese government worth 503.1 million RMB for the Gto Gbtégbodji-Atlada section of the road. Lot 3 represents the Atlada-Bohicon section of the road and this loan is to finance this part [4].
 
According to a working paper from the London School of Economics (LSE); Lot 3 was particularly controversial because the Chinese company refused to appoint an independent control bureau and threatened to withdraw the loan if a Chinese bureau was not appointed. The project employed few local materials and workers and was affected by delays caused by strikes from local workers over poor working conditions. [5]
 
As of 2018; the project implementation is expected to take about 8 months starting in May 2018. The date of completion was supposed to be January 2019; however no sources have confirmed full completion so the project is still in implementation [6].

The project was aimed at developing the tourist sector along Ivory Coast's south coast and helping ease congestion in Abidjan.(1) The opening ceremony was held on August 4; 2012 (2; 3). Out of the total cost of 62 billion FCFA; China provided 52.7 billion FCFA (4). The Chinese company China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the main contractor.  The first phase of the project was completed on April 7; 2015; and all lines were completed on September 14; 2015  (5). 

The 42-km toll road has 2X3 lanes. The entire project includes constructing 28-km new roads and rehabilitating 14-km old roads. The completion of the construction was delayed for 12 months due to the resettlement of local residents. (6)

Sinohydro completed construction in 2017; making this the country’s largest hydropower project to date with a generation capacity of 275 MW. 

The total cost of the project was $571 million USD; of which 85% was financed by China’s EXIM Bank and 15% by the Cote d’Ivoire government (unclear of exact financiers). EXIM Bank’s loan for this project totaled to about $500 million USD with a 2% interest rate; 20-year term; and a 9-year grace period [1]. The loan agreement was signed on January 9; 2013 by Cote d’Ivoire’s Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan and the Chinese Ambassador to Cote d’Ivoire Zhang Guoqing [2]. Prior to 2013; the project was dormant for several decades due to lack of funding [3].

The project was constructed by China-based Sinohydro Corporation. French company; Tractebel Engineering; was in charge of quality supervision of the dam’s construction [4]. Located at Naoua Falls on the Sassandra river; the dam is 19 meters high and 4.5 km long with 4 turbines. The project also includes a spillway; a mini-hydropower plant; driving turbines with the instream flow; a water intake linked to three penstocks of 8 meters in diameter; an outlet canal of 2.5 km; a motorway bridge; the switchyard and 380 km of 225 HT power line linking the cities of Soubré and Abidjan [5]. The project boosted the country’s power capacity by 10% and is part of the government’s plan to increase the share of hydro resources in its energy mix from 30% to 40% by 2020.

Construction was completed a year ahead of schedule. The hydropower dam was commissioned in March 2017 and officially inaugurated on November 2; 2017 [6] [7].

The Bui Hydroelectric Station was inaugurated in 2013. 
The original total cost of the project was $622 million USD; of which $562 million; made up of a Concessionary Loan of US$268.5 million and a Buyer’s Credit Loan of US$293.5 million; was financed by China’s EXIM Bank and $60 million by the Government of Ghana [1]. However; the actual disbursed amount differed from the plan. The actual amount of the concessional loan recorded in Ghana's budget statements was US$306 million; with an interest rate of 2%; grace of 5 years; and term of 20 years [2]. The amount of buyer’s credit loan recorded in the budget statement is US$292 million; with 17 year term; 5 year grace; and "CIRR X 107.5% (6.13 % interest rate) [3]. The loans were backed by Ghanaian cocoa. The Chinese government was guaranteed purchase of 30;000 tons of cocoa yearly at world market rates until the dam became operational [4].
During construction; the Bui Project experienced a shortfall in project funding arising primarily from “the unanticipated effects of the recent global upheavals as well as unforeseen essential works and the inadequacy of the budget provided for some line items in the contract” [5]. Therefore; the Government of Ghana had to secure additional funding of US$75 million (GH.022) and US$76 million (GH.023) from the Eximbank of China in 2012. Total loan related to this project amounts to US$749.6 million [6].

Built by the China-based Sinohydro Corporation as part of an Engineering; Procurement; and Construction (EPC) Turnkey Project Contract; the project is owned and managed by Bui Power Authority (BPA). Bui Dam is located on the Black Volta River in the Brong Ahafo Region. It generates 400MW of power and facilitates irrigation of about 30;000 hectares of land for agricultural production [7]. It is a gravity roller-compacted concrete dam and has three generating units; each with 133.3 MW. It also has a switchyard and transmission lines constructed to evacuate power from the plant. The station amounts to an average annual generation of 1;000 GWh; which represents 20 percent of the country's installed capacity. Apart from energy supply; the Bui Dam Project will be used to irrigate 30;000 hectares of land for agricultural production [8].

Although auxiliary construction work appeared to still be in progress in 2015; the Bui Hydroelectric Station was inaugurated on December 19th 2013 by the President of Ghana; Mr John Dramani Mahama [9]. The dam has been in operation since then. In 2017; Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) sought parliamentary approval for a loan to finance the 2017/2018 crop season and cited that it was experiencing financial distress due to payment to outstanding debt services including the Bui dam loan [10].

The project was completed in 2014 by Sinopec. 

Ghana entered into a US$3 billion loan agreement with the China Development Bank in 2011 to finance 12 different infrastructure projects. The loan was originally available in two tranches: Tranche A; US$1.5 billion; interest rate at 6 month LIBOR + 2.95% per annum; with 15 years repayment period with 5 years grace period; Tranche B US$1.5 billion; interest rate at 6 month LIBOR + 2.95% per annum; with 10 years repayment period with 3 years grace period. To support repayment of the loan; an Offtake Agreement of 13000bbl/day crude oil was signed between Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and China International United Petroleum & Chemicals Co.; Ltd. (UNIPEC Asia) for the sale and purchase of crude oil. The period of the Offtake Agreement is 15 years and 6 months [1]. 

However; the drop in crude oil prices in 2014 weakened the Government of Ghana’s ability to support its repayment obligations. The MFA was thus amended in 2018 to offer only US1.5 billion in Tranche B; terms modified to a 9-year tenor with a 3-year grace period; with interest rate at 6M LIBOR + 2.85% per annum for the third and fourth SAs. The borrower also procured a Sinosure credit insurance charged at 5.56% of both the principal and interest amounts. 85% of the Sinosure premium is financed by CDB and the remaining by the Government of Ghana [2]. 

In April 2012; the Ghanian Ambassador in China; Helen Mamle Kofi; signed the SA for Western Corridor Gas Infrastructure Project (WCGIP) with representatives of the China Development Bank in Beijing [3]. Since the loan was signed in Tranche B; it has an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + 2.95% per annum; with a 10-year repayment period and 3-year grace period. The project involves the construction of an offshore gas gathering pipeline; early phase gas processing plant; onshore gas trunk pipeline; including pumpuni dispatch terminal; NGLs processing retrofit (tema oil refinery); and helicopter surveillance fleet. The project was contracted to Sinopec and operated by Ghana National Gas Company. The goal of the project is to wean Ghana off its $3 mn per day purchase of foreign oil [4].

The government completed the gas processing plant and pipelines in Nov 2014[5]. Phase two of the project was completed in 2017 [6]. As of today; four Subsidiary Agreements have been signed under the  CDB MFA; totaling US$1396.41 million [7].

In April 2013; the second SA amounting to US$150 million was signed for the ICT Enhanced Surveillance Project (ALPHA) Phase 1. Although the loan purpose referred to in the CDB MFA was to deploy an ICT-based integrated communications platform to enhance security and surveillance of all infrastructure and facilities in the Western Corridor “Oil Enclave;” [3] the scope of the project expanded to a national security and public safety system [4]. The project developer was the National Security Council; and implementation was under a performance-based design-build-maintain contract carried out by Huawei at the cost of US$176 million [5]. Since the loan was signed in Tranche B; it has an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + 2.95% per annum; with a 10-year repayment period and 3-year grace period. The project provides the underlying infrastructure for national security and emerging response priority communications for both voice and data; as well as the backbone for the nationwide video surveillance (CCTV). It also delivers a national Emergency Command Center. The loan agreement for Phase II of the project was signed in 2019 [6]. 

Phase I had been completed by 2019 [7].

CHEC is implementing the project.

Ghana entered into a US$3 billion loan agreement with the China Development Bank in 2011 to finance 12 different infrastructure projects. The loan was originally available in two tranches: Tranche A; US$1.5 billion; interest rate at 6 month LIBOR + 2.95% per annum; with 15 years repayment period with 5 years grace period; Tranche B US$1.5 billion; interest rate at 6 month LIBOR + 2.95% per annum; with 10 years repayment period with 3 years grace period.

However; the drop in crude oil prices in 2014 weakened the Government of Ghana’s ability to support its repayment obligations.

The borrower also procured a Sinosure credit insurance charged at 5.56% of both the principal and interest amounts. 85% of the Sinosure premium is financed by CDB and the remaining by the Government of Ghana [2]. 


The coastal fishing landing sites project was originally placed under Tranche A; but after the Government of Ghana’s negotiation with the CDB; the project was moved to Tranche B with the amended loan terms with a 9-year tenor; a 3-year grace period; with interest rate at 6M LIBOR + 2.85% per annum so that the crude oil offtake agreement would not extend beyond its current term. Loan amount is US$208 million. The 10 fishing landing sites are planned to be located in Techie; Axim; Dixcove; Elmina; Winneba; Mumford; Senya-Beraku; Fetteh-Gomoa; Moree; and Keta [3]. The Elmina Project was removed because of inadequate funding planned under the MFA; and the funding has been shifted to two additional fish landing sites in Ekumfi in the Central Region and Osu in the Greater Accra Region [4]. The project is aimed to improve fishing infrastructure; ensure safe and hygienic fishing activities; and increase local employment opportunities. The 11 fishing landing sites are being constructed by the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) and supported by the Bluestone Infrastructure Company Ltd (BIC) as the main contractor’s local partner. [5]

The project commenced on July 24; 2019 when Ambassador Shi Ting Wang attended the ground breaking ceremony of Axim fishing port in the Western Region. It is planned to take 30 months to complete [6].

The Accra Intelligent Traffic Management System and Road Completion Project is the fourth subsidiary agreement signed under the MFA. It was originally placed under Tranche A but has been moved to Tranche B with the amended loan terms with a 9-year tenor; a 3-year grace period; with interest rate at 6M LIBOR + 2.85% per annum so that the crude oil offtake agreement would not extend beyond its current term. Total project cost is estimated to be US$236.1 million; and CDB is financing 85% of it at US$210.66 million including US$9.96 million for the Sinosure premium [3].

Phase 1 of the Beach Road project (Tema Road: Independence Arch to Nungua Barrier; 16km) has been contracted to China Gansu International Corporation for Economic and Technical Cooperation; and phase 2 (Coastal and Meridian Roads - Nungua Barrier to Tema) has been contracted to China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group in 2012. The contracts were approved by parliament in 2012; renewed several times; and were officially signed in 2019 [4]. While construction of the road project has started in August 2020; the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management System Project has been delayed due to re-awarding of the contract. The project was originally contracted to Beijing Everyway Traffic & Lighting Tech and Powerchina STECOL; but the Government of Ghana kept delaying payment and switched project contractor to Huawei Technologies Company Limited and the China National Import and Export Corporation in July 2020 for disagreement on the conditionality of the original contract. Beijing Everyway is seeking $55 million dollars in damages from the Ghana government at the London court of international arbitration as of Feb. 13; 2021 [5].

In phase II; Huawei upgraded the Worldwide Interoperability for Wireless Microwave Access (WiMaX) network to Long Term Evolution (LTE) network and constructed 21 Enhanced Community Information Centre (e-CIC) equipped with computer-seater facilities in remote rural areas [3]. Huawei also constructed a primary national data centre that facilitates the efficient delivery of government services and serves the private sector in Accra and a secondary centre in Kumasi [4].

The project was completed in 2016.

Ltd. signed a Master Project Support Agreement (MPSA) for US$2.0 billion to support priority infrastructure projects in Ghana. Several roads within this agreement are now under construction.

Sinohydro finances 85% of the total construction cost under the EPC contract with the support of refinancing by one or more financiers and export credit insurance underwritten by Sinosure. The projects are financed by way of deferral of payments in which the Government of Ghana repays using proceeds of the sale of refined bauxite following a deferred schedule stipulated respectively for each project’s own deferred payment agreement. While the Govt. of Ghana is responsible for the remaining 15% of the construction cost; Sinohydro agreed to arrange financing for the 15% along similar terms in this agreement. The MPSA is considered as a “barter agreement” and not a loan agreement; and thus does not add to Ghana’s public debt [1].

The MPSA funds projects comprising rural electrification; construction of hospitals; bridges; roads; affordable housing; fishing landing sites; among others. The first phase covers the following road infrastructure projects:
Accra Inner City Roads
Kumasi Inner City Roads
Tamale Interchange Project
PTC Roundabout Interchange Project; Takoradi
Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway
Sunyani Inner City Roads
Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads
Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Regions
Rehabilitation of Oda - Ofoase - Abirem Road
Hohoe - Jasikan - Dodi Pepesu Road

Total EPC amount for phase 1 is US$ 646.6 million and the Deferred Payment Agreements amount to US$550 million; have a tenor of 15 years; a 3-year grace period; an interest rate of 6 months US Libor + 2.8% per annum; 0.70% management fee; 0.5% per annum commitment fee; and a sinosure premium of 7.00% [2].  

The projects are expected to be completed in 30 months. The first project that went under construction; the Tamale Interchange Project; will be completed in July; 2021[3].

Eximbank China provided 75% of finance of the $446-million project in the form of preferential buyer's credit; with the other 25% of the finance provided as equity by the Guinean government (2; 3). 

The sites of Kaleta on the lower Konkouré have been identified since the 1940s; as electricity production is needed for aluminium plants. However; due to the break-up in diplomatic relationship between Guinea and France; the development of hydroelectric power in Guinea was stalled due to a lack of funding. It was not until 1999 that the feasibility studies of the Kaleta dam were first conducted within the Souapiti/Kaleta hydroelectric complex (7). 

The construction of the Kaleta dam began in April 2012. It  began to fill water in April 2015; and by May 28; 2015 turbines began to run and distribute electricity. The official inaugural ceremony was in September 2015 (6). Guinea’s electricity subsidies increased to 0.8 percent of GDP in the first half of 2019 because its state-owned electricity company; the Public Utility Company (EDG); started to pay for the electricity generated by Kaleta in January 2019 (5). 

In 2018; the Guinean government created a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)  to operate the dam; the Société de Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA); and sold a 49% stake to the contractor; CWE; in exchange for a US$200M equity contribution from CWE (7) (8). Guinea then used the funds from this transaction to pay for its share of equity in the SPV created for the Souapiti Dam (GN.007); Société de Gestion et d'exploitation de Souapiti (SOGES) (7) (9).  

The outstanding debt owed by Guinea for this project by June 2020 is $404 million (4).

(1) 

The site of Souapiti on the lower Konkouré has been identified since the 1940s; as electricity production is needed for aluminium plants. The first feasibility and evaluation study of Souapiti was conducted in 1948. The construction plan for the project was finalized in 1957; and preparatory works were initiated in 1958; including building roads; bridges; and cities around the sites. However; the breakdown of Guinea-France diplomatic relationship in 1958 stopped the work of Souapiti due to a lack of funding. It was not until after 1978; when France and Guinea restarted cooperation that the feasibility study of Souapiti became re-initiated. In November 2013; the China Water and Electric Company (CWE) submitted a first feasibility study for Souapiti; proposing a 2-phase construction plan for Souapiti. In December 2015; the CWE submitted an updated report on the feasibility of Souapiti; proposing a EPC contract that involves a 58-month construction period. The total amount of the EPC contract is $1.6 billion and was financed through a combination of equity (25%) and debt (75%). 

For the debt; the China Eximbank provided a $1.176 billion non-concessional loan. This loan will then be transferred to the SPV created for the Souapiti Dam; Société de Gestion et d'exploitation de Souapiti (SOGES); which is owned by the Guinean government (51 percent) and the CWE (49 percent). The grant element of the loan is roughly 29 percent. The SPV will manage and operate the dam on a commercial basis. For the equity portion; to obtain extra funding; the Guinean government transferred part of its share in the Kaleta dam SPV SOGEKA to the Chinese contractor CWE in exchange for a $200M equity contribution from the CWE. The Guinean government then contributed the $200M obtained from divestment of the Kaleta dam to the Souapiti dam; while the CWE also contributed $200M to SOGES (2; 3; 7). $925 million and $250 million of the Souapiti loan are expected to be disbursed respectively in 2020 and 2021 (2; 3; 4). 

The construction started in April 2016 and was contracted to the China International Water and Electric Corporation (5). On April 9; 2021; all of the power generators of Souapiti were completed and put into use (6).

The refinery is operated by a joint venture; the Zinder Refining Company (SORAZ); which is a partnership between the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) (taking a 60% share of the JV) and the government of Niger (taking 40% of the shares using sovereign guarantee). (1) The total cost of the SORAZ is $980 million; of which $880 million (437.4 billion XOF; or 12% of 2013 GDP) was financed through a concessional loan from the China Eximbank to SORAZ. The Niger government is responsible for paying back $352 million (40%) of the loan. (2) 

Initially; the terms of loan included a maturity of 11 years and an interest rate of Libor +3.5%. In 2012 the SORAZ refinery faced a loss of around $40 million due to a production shortfall; and SORAZ attempted to renegotiate a refinancing with Eximbank at an interest rate of 2 percent and a maturity of 20 years (2; 3). However; the refinancing never happened. The negotiation ended up being stalled for over two years while the SORAZ appeared to service its debt normally (4; 5). The performance of the SORAZ refinery has since improved and generated a small surplus in 2013. It started producing at a full capacity in 2014; producing 20;000 barrels per day. (6; 7) In 2018; $162 million of the publicly guaranteed $352 million loan was still included in the debt stock; and the maturity was rescheduled and extended from 2019 to 2023 (4).

The Azelik mine started operation on March 17; 2011 (4). It reached a maximum capacity of 700 tons per year in 2012 (2). However; due to the delay of construction and excess budget; production has stopped since February 2015 to save costs given the low commodity price of uranium (5; 6). In addition; local protests over the lack of employment of local ethnic groups; low wages; and environmental pollution also put pressure on the joint venture (10; 11). Its production remained stopped as of 2020 (7).

The loan had an interest rate of 6%; a maturity of 12 years with a 6-year grace period[1] and financed 65% of the total construction cost [2]. CNPC secured a  renewable deal to purchase 30;000 barrels of crude oil a day from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) for one year[3]. The power station has eight units with 42MW each but has been working below capacity due to gas supply shortages [4][5].

The power plant was inaugurated in 2007. In 2011; the Federal Government of Nigeria decided to divest its investment and signed Power Purchase Agreements with SEPCO III and CMEC to convert the loan into equity and sell the government’s 40% share of the Olorunsogo and Oshomoto power plants at US$10.1 million. The agreements went into effect in 2013 and 2014 and freed the government from repaying the loans [6].

While ZTE claimed that it has completed each of the components; and the Government of Nigeria has been repaying the loan on schedule; the project was requested to be investigated for several times. In 2011; the House of Representatives investigated compliance with due process in the award of the contract and the execution of the project by ZTE Corporation[4]. In 2014; the Federal High Court ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to investigate if there was corruption in the contract awarding process[5]. In 2019; the Federal High Court approved the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project to investigate the Federal Government’s spending of the loan[6]. The CCTV cameras; though installed; seemed not to have been in operation and were allegedly of low-quality[7]. Since 2018; the Government of Nigeria has been planning to revive and expand the project despite its controversy[8].

(1) The $165 million USD public-private-partnership was signed on April 26; 2016.(2) CRSG constructed the road on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) agreement; with the tolls generated from use of the road repaying construction costs. The Government of Sierra Leone guaranteed the project as a contingent liability; if; for example; the toll revenue does not cover the loan repayments. (3)

An initiative of President Koroma; the 67 kilometer toll-road aimed to improve traffic by widening the dual carriageway. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Works and the China Railway 7th Group signed the framework agreement for the project in December 2015 (4) The project faced resistance in Parliament; which required additional route planning before approving the project in February 2016. (5) All parties then reached full agreement on April 26; 2016. (1) Under the terms of the BOOT agreement; China Railway 7th Group will operate and upkeep the toll-road for the first decade; before handing the project over to the Sierra Leone Roads Authority. (2) The BOOT agreement initially set the transfer of ownership to occur at 25 years; but the parties expanded the agreement to 27 years in 2017. (6)

China Railway 7th Group began collecting tolls on the road in 2017 (6); though the road was still under construction. The project continued to attract controversy however; and the Sierra Leone Roads Authority conducted an audit in 2018; Parliament referred the report to Sierra Leone’s Anti-Corruption Commission for further action. (6) The COVID-19 pandemic delayed construction of the toll road; and the project continues to face significant issues with toll evasion(7); which may trigger the sovereign guarantee.(3)
